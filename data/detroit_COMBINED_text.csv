The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time.

first,TAPPER,We also want to ask our audience inside the historic Fox Theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating. The candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another.,0,0.902,0.098,0.3818

first,BASH,Governor Steve Bullock please begin.,0,0.635,0.365,0.3182
first,BULLOCK,Thanks Dana ,0,0.256,0.744,0.4404
first,BULLOCK,I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump. Let's not kid ourselves. He will be hard to beat. Yet watching that last debate folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives.,0.024,0.889,0.087,0.5574
first,BULLOCK,Look I'm a pro-choice pro-union populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values but by getting stuff done. That's how we win back the places we lost: showing up listening focusing on the challenges of everyday Americans.,0.058,0.728,0.214,0.7845
first,BULLOCK,That farmer getting hit right now by Trump's trade wars that teacher working a second job just to afford her insulin. They can't wait for a revolution. Their problems are in the here and now.,0.169,0.831,0,-0.743
first,BULLOCK,I'm a progressive emphasis on progress and I'm running for president to get stuff done for all those Americans Washington has left behind.,0,0.882,0.118,0.4215
first,BASH,Marianne Williamson? ,0,1,0,0
first,WILLIAMSON,Thank you. ,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
first,WILLIAMSON,In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility. It was the idea that people no matter who they were would simply have the possibility of thriving. We have not ever totally actualized this ideal. But at the times when we have done best we have tried. And when forces have opposed them generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces.,0.029,0.846,0.125,0.8141
first,WILLIAMSON,We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights. And now it is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again for an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multi-national corporations into a false god. And this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live.,0.031,0.825,0.144,0.8225
first,WILLIAMSON,Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem. We the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility say no to what we don't want and yes to what we know can be true.,0.219,0.633,0.148,-0.3447
first,WILLIAMSON,I'm Marianne Williamson and that's why I'm running for president.,0,1,0,0
first,BASH,Congressman John Delaney?,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,Folks we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us which is with bad policies like Medicare for all free everything and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected. That's what happened with McGovern. That's what happened with Mondale. That's what happened with Dukakis. Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal health care for every American with choice someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere. And then we win the White House. ,0.031,0.787,0.183,0.9371
first,DELANEY,I'm the product of the American dream. I believe in it. I'm the grandson of immigrants the son of a construction worker. My wife April and I have four amazing daughters. I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange created thousands of jobs and then served in Congress. That's the type of background  and my platform is about real solutions not impossible promises that can beat Trump and govern. Thank you.,0.027,0.825,0.148,0.8323
first,BASH,Congressman Tim Ryan?,0,1,0,0
first,RYAN,America is great but not everyone can access America's greatness. The systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the American people. The economic system that used to create $30 $40 $50 an hour jobs that you can have a good solid middle-class living now force us to have two or three jobs just to get by. ,0,0.834,0.166,0.8735
first,RYAN,Most families when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills they get a pit in the middle of their stomach. We deserve better. And the political system is broken too because the entire conversation is about left or right where are you at on the political system? And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right. This is about new and better. And it's not about reforming old systems. It's about building new systems.,0.036,0.896,0.068,0.4019
first,RYAN,And tonight I will offer solutions that are bold that are realistic and that are a clean break from the past.,0,0.696,0.304,0.7184
first,BASH,Governor John Hickenlooper?,0,1,0,0
first,HICKENLOOPER,Last year Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the House and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage. ,0,0.916,0.084,0.3182
first,HICKENLOOPER,Now I share their progressive values but I'm a little more pragmatic. I was out of work for two whole years until I started what became the largest brew pub in America. And I learned the small  small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor and as governor of Colorado created the number one economy in the country.,0,0.849,0.151,0.765
first,HICKENLOOPER,We also expanded health care and reproductive rights. We attacked climate change head-on. We beat the NRA. We did not build massive government expansions.,0.106,0.78,0.113,0.0516
first,HICKENLOOPER,Now some will promise a bill tonight or a plan for tonight. What we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done to provide solutions to problems to make sure that we  that we worked together and created jobs. That's how we're going to beat Donald Trump. That's how we're going to win Michigan and the country.,0.037,0.729,0.234,0.9062
first,BASH,Senator Amy Klobuchar?,0,1,0,0
first,KLOBUCHAR,Let's get real. Tonight we debate but ultimately we have to beat Donald Trump. My background it's a little different than his. I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man as the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States. ,0,0.943,0.057,0.5719
first,KLOBUCHAR,That's because we come from a country of shared dreams and I have had it with the racist attacks. I have had it with a president that says one thing on TV that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college.,0.155,0.757,0.088,-0.5994
first,KLOBUCHAR,You're going to hear a lot of promises up here but I'm going to tell you this. Yes I have bold ideas but they are grounded in reality. And yes I will make some simple promises. I can win this. I'm from the Midwest. And I have won every race every place every time. And I will govern with integrity the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.,0,0.592,0.408,0.99
first,BASH,Congressman Beto O'Rourke?,0,1,0,0
first,O'ROURKE,I'm running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need. This moment will define us forever and I believe that in this test America will be redeemed. ,0,0.827,0.173,0.7579
first,O'ROURKE,In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone for the rule of law for everyone and a democracy that serves everyone. Whatever our differences we know that before we are anything else we are Americans first and we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential.,0.085,0.859,0.056,-0.5267
first,O'ROURKE,We will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad successfully confronting endless war and climate change. At this moment of truth let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone by everyone and for everyone.,0.089,0.698,0.213,0.7645
first,BASH,Mayor Pete Buttigieg?,0,1,0,0
first,BUTTIGIEG,I'm running for president because our country is running out of time. It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency. Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. ,0.127,0.821,0.051,-0.5719
first,BUTTIGIEG,It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis  an economy that's not working for everyone endless war climate change. We have lived this in my industrial Midwestern hometown. My generation has lived this as long as we have been alive.,0.165,0.782,0.053,-0.7506
first,BUTTIGIEG,And it's only accelerating. Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate. By 2030 the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a women's right to choose may not even exist.,0.089,0.889,0.022,-0.6486
first,BUTTIGIEG,We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments policies and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive. We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different. This is our shot. That is why I'm running for president.,0.043,0.864,0.093,0.4767
first,BASH,Senator Elizabeth Warren?,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day. And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president. I promise no matter who our candidate is I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a Democratic Congress. ,0.044,0.828,0.127,0.4767
first,WARREN,But our problems didn't start with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is part of a corrupt rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else.,0.194,0.742,0.064,-0.6249
first,WARREN,We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change. We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone.,0.151,0.722,0.127,-0.0987
first,WARREN,You know I know what's broken in this country I know how to fix it and I will fight to make it happen.,0.241,0.759,0,-0.6908
first,BASH,Senator Bernie Sanders?,0,1,0,0
first,SANDERS,Tonight in America as we speak 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured but the health care industry made $100 billion in profits last year. ,0,0.738,0.262,0.8462
first,SANDERS,Tonight as we speak right now 500000 Americans are sleeping out on the street and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.,0,0.775,0.225,0.7503
first,SANDERS,Tonight half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck and yet 49 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.,0,0.927,0.073,0.2023
first,SANDERS,Tonight the fossil fuel industry continues to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet. We have got to take on Trump's racism his sexism xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat Trump but to transform our economy and our government. ,0.082,0.888,0.03,-0.4696
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator Sanders. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,TAPPER,Let's start the debate with the number-one issue for Democratic voters health care. And Senator Sanders let's start with you. You support Medicare for all which would eventually take private health insurance away from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for government-sponsored health care for everyone.,0,0.829,0.171,0.8442
first,TAPPER,"Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy. And previously he has called the idea ""political suicide that will just get President Trump re-elected."" What do you say to Congressman Delaney?",0.211,0.789,0,-0.8402
first,SANDERS,You're wrong. ,0.756,0.244,0,-0.4767
first,SANDERS,Right now we have a dysfunctional health care system: 87 million uninsured or underinsured $500000  500000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills 30000 people dying while the health care industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit.,0.074,0.736,0.19,0.6908
first,SANDERS,Five minutes away from me and John is a country it's called Canada. They guarantee health care to every man woman and child as a human right. They spend half of what we spend. And by the way when you end up in a hospital in Canada you come out with no bill at all. Health care is a human right not a privilege. I believe that I will fight for that.,0.093,0.794,0.113,0.3591
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator Sanders. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,TAPPER,Congressman Delaney?,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,Well I'm right about this. We can create a universal health care system to give everyone basic health care for free and I have a proposal to do it. But we don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal. ,0.053,0.704,0.243,0.9001
first,DELANEY,My dad the union electrician loved the health care he got from the IBEW. He would never want someone to take that away. Half of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare Advantage which is private insurance or supplemental plans. It's also bad policy. It'll underfund the industry many hospitals will close,0.078,0.726,0.196,0.8008
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,DELANEY, and it's bad policy. ,0.538,0.462,0,-0.5423
first,TAPPER,Senator Sanders I want to  I,0,0.698,0.302,0.0772
first,TAPPER,WARREN (?): My name was also mentioned in this.,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,We're going to come to you in one second but let me go to Senator Sanders right now. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Senator Sanders?,0,1,0,0
first,SANDERS,The fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs or their employer changes that insurance. If you want stability in the health care system if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to a doctor or a hospital which is a system which will not bankrupt you the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies,0.051,0.783,0.166,0.8282
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,SANDERS, and the insurance companies move to Medicare for all. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Congressman Delaney? ,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,But now he's talking about a different issue. What I'm talking about is really simple. We should deal with the tragedy of the (ph),0.167,0.833,0,-0.6597
first,DELANEY,uninsured and give everyone health care as a right. But why do we got to be the party of taking something away from people?,0,0.781,0.219,0.7096
first,WARREN,No. No one is the party,0.436,0.297,0.267,-0.1779
first,TAPPER,Hold on one second Senator. ,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,That's what they're running on. They're running on,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,No. ,1,0,0,-0.296
first,DELANEY, telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal. It says it right in the bill. ,0.184,0.816,0,-0.5574
first,TAPPER,All right thank you. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,DELANEY,We don't have to do that. We can give everyone health care,0,0.775,0.225,0.4939
first,DELANEY,TAPPER (?): OK.,0,0.405,0.595,0.4466
first,DELANEY, and allow people to have choice. That's the American way. ,0,0.826,0.174,0.2263
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,TAPPER,Senator Warren?,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,So look. Let's  let's be clear about this. We are the Democrats. We are not about trying to take away health care from anyone. That's what the Republicans are trying to do. ,0,0.838,0.162,0.7003
first,WARREN,And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care.,0.074,0.676,0.25,0.7351
first,WARREN,Now I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Ady Barkan. Ady is 35 years old. He has a wife Rachael he has a cute little boy named Carl. He also has ALS and it's killing him. Ady has health insurance good health insurance,0.079,0.699,0.222,0.7184
first,TAPPER,Senator? ,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN, and it's not nearly enough. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Senator? I want to  I'm coming right,0,0.794,0.206,0.0772
first,WARREN,No this is important. ,0.367,0.333,0.3,-0.1027
first,TAPPER, I'm staying with you I'm staying with you. But you exceeded your time. So let me just stay with you on Medicare for all. ,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,All right. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,"At the last debate you said you're quote ""with Bernie on Medicare for all."" Now Senator Sanders has said that people in the middle class will pay more in taxes to help pay for Medicare for all though that will be offset by the elimination of insurance premiums and other costs. Are you also quote ""with Bernie"" on Medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it? ",0.055,0.91,0.035,0.128
first,WARREN,So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more. Middle-class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care. And I'd like to finish talking about Ady the guy who has ALS,0.067,0.795,0.137,0.5994
first,WARREN,"This isn't funny. This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying. And every month he has about $9000 in medical bills that his insurance company won't cover. His wife Rachael is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company ""Please cover what the doctors say he needs."" ",0.042,0.917,0.041,-0.0274
first,WARREN,He talks about what it's like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends family and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses.,0,0.828,0.172,0.6808
first,WARREN,The basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. That is not working for Americans,0.035,0.81,0.154,0.6908
first,TAPPER,Thank you. ,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
first,WARREN, across this country,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,WARREN,Medicare for All will fix that and that's why I'll fight for it. ,0.178,0.822,0,-0.3818
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. Just a point of clarification,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
first,TAPPER,in 15 extra seconds would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All offset obviously by the elimination of insurance premiums yes or no?,0.111,0.805,0.084,0.0258
first,WARREN,Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations. For middle-class families costs  total costs  will go down. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Governor Bullock I want to bring you in. You do not support Medicare for All. How do you respond to Senator Warren? ,0.1,0.842,0.058,-0.2401
first,BULLOCK,No health care is so personal to all of us. Never forget when my 12-year-old son had a heart attack within 24 hours of his life. Had to be life-flighted to Salt Lake City. But because we had good insurance he's here with me tonight. ,0.102,0.749,0.149,0.354
first,BULLOCK,At the end of the day I'm not going to support any plan that rips away quality health care from individuals. This is an example of wish list economics. It used to be just Republicans who wanted to repeal and replace. Now many Democrats do as well. We can get there with a public option negotiating drug prices ending,0.035,0.84,0.124,0.6948
first,TAPPER,Thank you Governor Bullock. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,TAPPER,I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg. On the topic of whether or not the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for guaranteed health care and the elimination of insurance premiums how do you respond Mayor?,0.035,0.852,0.113,0.4767
first,BUTTIGIEG,So we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test. ,0,0.854,0.146,0.7003
first,BUTTIGIEG,That's the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal. That way if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off their insurance.,0.02,0.94,0.04,0.1082
first,TAPPER,Just 15 seconds on the clarification. You are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums yes or no? ,0.067,0.851,0.082,0.128
first,BUTTIGIEG,I think you can buy into it. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. Look this is a distinction without a difference whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look in this country if you have health coverage  if you don't have health coverage you're paying too much for care and if you do have health coverage you're paying too much for care.,0,0.896,0.104,0.7717
first,TAPPER,Thank you Mayor Buttigieg. I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke on the topic of whether the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for universal coverage and the elimination of insurance premiums. What's your response? ,0.037,0.864,0.099,0.34
first,O'ROURKE,The answer is no. The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class health care. I think we're being offered a false choice some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance I have a better path. ,0.03,0.713,0.256,0.9259
first,O'ROURKE,Medicare for America. Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled,0,1,0,0

first,O'ROURKE,You have some. Governor Bullock who's said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people's choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions. I was listening to Dee Taylor (ph),0,0.889,0.111,0.7269

first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. Governor Bullock,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,TAPPER, he just said you're offering a false choice sir. ,0,1,0,0
first,BULLOCK,Congressman not at all. You know it took us decades and false starts to get the Affordable Care Act. So let's actually build on it. A public option allowing anyone to buy in. ,0,0.906,0.094,0.4939
first,BULLOCK,You know we pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world. We got nothing to show for it. Negotiate prescription drug prices. End surprise medical billing. That's the way that we can get there without disrupting the lives of 160 million people that like their employer-sponsored health insurance.,0.025,0.891,0.084,0.4939
first,TAPPER,Congressman O'Rourke you can respond. Congressman O'Rourke you can respond.,0,1,0,0
first,O'ROURKE,Every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need as the example that Senator Warren showed us. ,0,0.924,0.076,0.4939
first,O'ROURKE,Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance. When we listen to the American people  and this is what they want us to do  they want everyone covered but they want to be able to maintain choice,0,0.916,0.084,0.1901
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar. ,0,0.648,0.352,0.4215
first,TAPPER,Senator Warren at the beginning of the night said that Democrats cannot bring  cannot win the White House with small ideas and spinelessness. In the last debate she said the politicians who are not supporting Medicare for All simply lack the will to fight for it. You do not support Medicare for All. Is Senator Warren correct? Do you just not lack the will to fight for it?,0.189,0.778,0.032,-0.8831
first,KLOBUCHAR,That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates Jake I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent. And when she said it I said thank you. ,0,0.829,0.171,0.7184
first,KLOBUCHAR,So this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That's what Barack Obama wanted and it would bring health care costs down for everyone.,0,0.901,0.099,0.4939
first,KLOBUCHAR,And by the way I just don't buy this. I've heard some of these candidates say that it's somehow not moral if you  not moral to not have that public option. Well Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was Bernie the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced.,0,0.962,0.038,0.2732
first,KLOBUCHAR,Clearly this is the easiest way to move forward quickly and I want to get things done. People can't wait. I've got my friend Nicole out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager.

first,SANDERS,As the author  as the author of the Medicare bill let me clear up one thing. As people talk about having insurance there are millions of people who have insurance they can't go to the doctor and when they come out of the hospital they go bankrupt. All right? ,0.068,0.883,0.049,-0.25
first,SANDERS,What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments. And Jake your question is a Republican talking point. At the end of the day,0.132,0.868,0,-0.5267
first,SANDERS,And by the way  and by the way  by the way  the health care industry will be advertising tonight on this program.,0,0.868,0.132,0.4939

first,SANDERS,They will be advertising tonight with that talking point. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Senator Warren?,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,So we have to think of this in terms of the big frame. What's the problem in Washington? It works great for the wealthy. It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers. And it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. ,0.043,0.72,0.237,0.9201
first,WARREN,What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a God-given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our health care system.,0.12,0.677,0.203,0.5859

first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. If we could all just stick to the rules of the time that would be great. Congressman Delaney?,0,0.742,0.258,0.765
first,DELANEY,So I was  I'm the only one on this stage who actually has experience in the health care business. And with all due respect I don't think my colleagues understand the business. We have the public option which is great.,0,0.771,0.229,0.886
first,SANDERS,It's not a business!,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,The public option is great but it doesn't go far enough. It doesn't go far enough. I'm proposing universal health care where everyone gets health care as a basic human right for free but they have choices. My plan BetterCare is fully paid for without raising middle class tax options. So when we think about this debate,0,0.769,0.231,0.9485

first,DELANEY,I was interrupted. ,0.688,0.312,0,-0.296
first,TAPPER,I want to bring in  I want to bring in Governor Hickenlooper. Governor Hickenlooper I'd like to hear what you say about Senator Warren's suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of Medicare for All lack the political will to fight for it. ,0.137,0.765,0.098,-0.4692
first,HICKENLOOPER,Well obviously I disagree with that as much as I respect both of the senators to my right. You know it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices to have the right to make a decision. And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare that maybe is a combination of Medicare Advantage and Medicare but people choose it and if enough people choose it it expands the quality improves the cost comes down more people choose it eventually in 15 years you could get there but it would be an evolution not a revolution. ,0.017,0.885,0.098,0.765
first,TAPPER,Thank you Governor. Senator Warren? ,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,WARREN,You know,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN, we have tried this experiment with the insurance companies. And what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system. And they force people to have to fight to try to get the health care coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. ,0.097,0.793,0.11,0.2023
first,WARREN,Why does everybody  why does every doctor why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms? It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.,0.055,0.896,0.05,-0.0516
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator Warren. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,WARREN,That's what we have to fight.,0.342,0.658,0,-0.3818
first,TAPPER,I want to bring in Marianne Williamson. Ms. Williamson how do you respond to the criticism from Senator Warren that you're not willing to fight for Medicare for All?,0.092,0.797,0.111,-0.1068
first,WILLIAMSON,I don't know if Senator Warren said that about me specifically. I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said.,0,0.876,0.124,0.4767
first,WILLIAMSON,But I have to say I have  I'm normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one. I hear the others. And I have some concern about that as well. And I do have concern about what the Republicans would say. And that's not just a Republican talking point. I do have concern that it will be difficult. I have concern that it will make it harder to win and I have a concern that it'll make it harder to govern. Because if that's our big fight then,0.059,0.874,0.068,0.2023
first,TAPPER,Thank you Ms. Williamson. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,WILLIAMSON,The Republicans will so shut us down on everything else. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg  Mayor Buttigieg your response? ,0,0.874,0.126,0.0772
first,BUTTIGIEG,It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. Look if  ,0.277,0.723,0,-0.5574
first,BUTTIGIEG,If it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda you know what they're going to do? They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.,0.104,0.736,0.16,0.3818
first,BUTTIGIEG,So let's just stand up for the right policy go out there and defend it. That's the policy I'm putting forward not because I think it's the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there  because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here  whose life was saved by the ACA but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her,0.073,0.881,0.046,-0.484
first,TAPPER,Thank you Mayor Buttigieg Senator Sanders your response? ,0,0.737,0.263,0.3612
first,SANDERS,Let's be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions. ,0.024,0.928,0.048,0.3182
first,SANDERS,That is why when I went to Canada the other day people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States,0,0.899,0.101,0.4215
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. I want to bring in Congressman Tim Ryan Congressman Ryan your response? ,0,0.759,0.241,0.4215
first,RYAN,So here we are in Detroit home of the United Auto workers. We have all our union friends here tonight. This plan that's being offered by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders will tell those Union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that they're going to lose their healthcare because Washington's going to come in and tell them they got a better plan. ,0.036,0.809,0.155,0.8402
first,RYAN,This is the left and right thing  new and better is this move Medicare down to 50. Allow people to buy-in Kaiser Permanente said that if they  those 60 million people do that they will see,0,0.876,0.124,0.5859
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,RYAN,A 40 percent reduction ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,RYAN,In their healthcare cost let businesses buy-in Jake ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. So Senator let's talk about that. If Medicare for all is enacted there are more than 600000 union members here in Michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans. ,0.076,0.861,0.063,-0.128
first,TAPPER,Now I understand that it would provide universal coverage  but can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under Medicare for all will be as good as the benefits that they're representatives  their union reps fought hard to negotiate?,0.09,0.651,0.259,0.8625
first,SANDERS,Well two things they will be better because Medicare for all is comprehensive  it covers all healthcare needs. For senior citizens it will finally include dental care hearing aids and eyeglasses.,0,0.726,0.274,0.8481
first,RYAN,But you don't know that  you don't know that Bernie. ,0,1,0,0
first,SANDERS,Second of all ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,I'll come to you in a second Congressman. ,0,1,0,0
first,SANDERS,I do know it I wrote the damn bill. And second of all second of all  many of our union brothers and sisters nobody more pro-union than me up here are now paying high deductibles and copayments when we do Medicare for all instead of having the company putting money in to healthcare they can get decent wage increases which they're not getting today. ,0.042,0.958,0,-0.4019
first,TAPPER,I want to bring in Congressman Ryan to respond to what Senator Sanders just said. ,0,0.909,0.091,0.0772
first,RYAN,I mean Senator Sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the United States. I'm trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs their wages have been stagnant the world is crumbling around them  the only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare.,0.049,0.84,0.112,0.5256
first,RYAN,And the Democratic message is going to be we're going to go in and the only thing you have left we're going to take it and we're going to do better. I do not think that's a recipe for success for us it's bad policy and it's certainly bad politics.,0.119,0.729,0.153,0.25
first,TAPPER,Congressman Delaney. ,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,So the bill that Senator Sanders drafted by definition will lower quality in healthcare because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates. And the data is clear Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare it covers 80 percent of the costs of healthcare in this country. ,0.039,0.915,0.046,0.1027
first,DELANEY,And private insurance covers 120 percent so if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers you're going to create a two tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash and the people who are forced  like my dad the union electrician,0.062,0.79,0.148,0.4767
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,DELANEY,Will have that healthcare plan taken away from him ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,DELANEY,They will be forced into an underfunded system. ,0.3,0.7,0,-0.4588
first,TAPPER,I want to give Senator Sanders  I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond. ,0,0.685,0.315,0.3818
first,SANDERS,On the Medicare for all the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today. ,0,0.865,0.135,0.6124
first,SANDERS,Second of all,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,I've done the math it doesn't add up. ,0,1,0,0
first,SANDERS,Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare but our job is to run a nonprofit healthcare system. Furthermore  furthermore when we say $500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy trying to deal with the health insurance companies ,0.062,0.938,0,-0.4767
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,SANDERS,Hospitals will be better off than they are today. ,0,0.734,0.266,0.4404
first,TAPPER,Congressman Delaney I want to let you have a chance to respond. ,0,0.708,0.292,0.3182
first,DELANEY,Listen his math is wrong. That's all I'm saying  that his math is wrong it's been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate which is specifically  I think it's in section 1200 of their bill then many hospitals in this country would close. ,0.124,0.876,0,-0.7351
first,DELANEY,"I've been going around rural America and I ask rural hospital administrators one question ""If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year what would happen?""",0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,"And they all look at me and say ""We would close.""",0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,But the question is why do we have to be so extreme? Why can't we just give everyone health care as a right and allow them to have choice?,0,0.826,0.174,0.6662
first,BASH,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

first,DELANEY, strategy.,0,1,0,0
first,BASH,We're going to move on to the issue of immigration now. There is,0,1,0,0
first,BASH,widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants including dreamers. But there are some areas of disagreement.,0.084,0.808,0.108,0.1779
first,BASH,Mayor Buttigieg you're in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the U.S. border illegally. Why won't that just encourage more illegal immigration?,0.26,0.67,0.07,-0.8123
first,BUTTIGIEG,When I am president illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law. But we've got a crisis on our hands. And it's not just a crisis of immigration; it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America. ,0.315,0.639,0.046,-0.9837
first,BUTTIGIEG,Americans want comprehensive immigration reform. And frankly we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime protections for DREAMers; making sure that  that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented; cleaning up lawful immigration.,0,0.862,0.138,0.5574
first,BUTTIGIEG,We know what to do. We know that border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington. And now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.,0.095,0.858,0.048,-0.6908
first,BASH,But just a point of clarification you did raise your hand in the last debate. You do want to decriminalize crossing the border illegally?,0,0.824,0.176,0.5423
first,BUTTIGIEG,So in my view if fraud is involved then that's suitable for the criminal statute. If not then it should be handled under civil law. But these show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being covered.,0.201,0.799,0,-0.8834
first,BASH,Well we're not  we're not doing that here. ,0,0.769,0.231,0.2732

first,O'ROURKE,I do because in my administration after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders more than 9 million of our fellow Americans; freed DREAMers from any fear of deportation; and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge; end for-profit detention in this country; and then assist,0.135,0.817,0.048,-0.5994
first,O'ROURKE,those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2000-mile journey than I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.,0.123,0.877,0,-0.6344
first,BASH,Thank you Congressman. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,BASH,Senator Warren you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary. Please respond.,0.313,0.573,0.114,-0.6728
first,WARREN,So the problem is that right now the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents. It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders. ,0.072,0.818,0.111,0.1585
first,WARREN,We need to continue to have border security and we can do that but what we can't do is not live our values. I've been down to the border. I have seen the mothers. I have seen the cages of babies. We must be a country that every day lives our values. And that means we cannot,0.099,0.872,0.029,-0.6217

first,HICKENLOOPER,I agree that we need secure borders. There's no question about that. And the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they're kicking the ball back and forth. Secure the borders make sure whatever law we have doesn't allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages. How hard can that be? ,0.129,0.723,0.148,0.3036
first,HICKENLOOPER,We've got  I don't know  on the two debate nights we've got 170 years of Washington experience. Somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable.,0,0.906,0.094,0.3612
first,WARREN,Well and one way to fix it is to decriminalize. That's the whole point. What we're,0,0.877,0.123,0.2732

first,KLOBUCHAR,I would say there is the will to change this in Congress. What's missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants don't diminish America; they are America. And if you want to do something,0.057,0.909,0.034,-0.2263
first,KLOBUCHAR,about border security you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those Northern Triangle countries.,0,0.888,0.112,0.34
first,KLOBUCHAR,Then you pass the bill. And what the bill will do is it will greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for border processing the cases. And most of all it will allow for a path to citizenship.,0.063,0.846,0.091,0.0865

first,BULLOCK,Look I think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from people's lives. We've got 100000 people showing up at the border right now. If we decriminalize entry if we give health care to everyone we'll have multiples of that.

first,RYAN,And even if you decriminalize which we should not do you still have statutory authority. The president could still use his authority to separate families. So we've got to get rid of Donald Trump. But you don't decriminalize people just walking into the United States. If they're seeking asylum of course we want to welcome them. We're a strong enough country to be able to welcome them.,0,0.787,0.213,0.9186

There were three large-scale shootings this past week in America at a park in Brooklyn on the streets on Philadelphia and one that left three dead and 12 injured at a food festival in Gilroy California. Governor - excuse me Mayor Buttigieg other than offering words of comfort what're you specially going to do to stop this epidemic of gun violence?,0.237,0.662,0.101,-0.9287
first,BUTTIGIEG,Well this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community too far too many times. It's the worst part of being there getting the phone call consoling grieving parents. And we have a mass shooting's worth of killings everyday in this country. What we're doing hasn't worked because we haven't had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want.,0.224,0.68,0.096,-0.926
first,BUTTIGIEG,Eighty 90 percent of Republicans want universal background checks not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarmed domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons things like what I carried overseas in uniform that have no business in American neighbors in peace time (ph),0.211,0.622,0.166,-0.6249

And we can talk about these policies but we already know the policies. I only thing I could think of looking into the eyes of this child is we're supposed to be dealing with this so you don't have to.

first,HICKENLOOPER,And we decided you know that we were going to go out and take on the NRA and we passed as a purple state. We passed universal background checks. We limited magazine capacity.

first,KLOBUCHAR,Yes this isn't just about a system or it's not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland because I've been a leader on these issues and have the will to close to a boyfriend loophole. ,0,0.884,0.116,0.6705
first,KLOBUCHAR,And I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day he goes and he meets with the NRA and he folds.

first,BUTTIGIEG,This is the exact same conversation we've been having since - since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We better not allow there to be a third. Something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do. They won't prevent every incident. They won't save every life. But we know what to do and it has not happened. ,0.079,0.878,0.043,-0.4344
first,LEMON,Thank you Mayor. Senator Klobuchar please respond. ,0,0.51,0.49,0.5859

first,KLOBUCHAR,After Parkland those students just didn't march. They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said there must be a better way. Then we elected people in the House of Representatives. And guess what? It changed and they passed universal background checks. And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell's doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president I will take them on.,0,0.962,0.038,0.4404

first,BULLOCK,We need to start looking at this as a public health issue not a political issue. I agree with Senator Klobuchar. It is the NRA. And it's not just gun violence. It's when we talked about climate when we talk about prescription drug costs Washington D.C. is captured by dark money the Koch brothers and others.,0.037,0.87,0.093,0.4973
first,BULLOCK,That's been the fight of my career. Kicking the Koch brothers out of Montana taking the first case after Citizens United up to the Supreme Court making it so that elections are about people. That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this Don is by changing that system. And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections.,0.028,0.871,0.1,0.765

first,O'ROURKE,How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40000 people in this country to gun violence a number that no other country comes even close to that we know what all the solutions are and yet nothing has changed? It is because in this country money buys influence access and increasingly outcomes. ,0.189,0.762,0.05,-0.8555
first,O'ROURKE,The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office.

Do you still agree with that statement today?",0.099,0.801,0.101,0.0258
first,SANDERS,I think we have got to do  I think what I meant is what President Obama said in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a magical solution to the crisis. ,0.113,0.824,0.063,-0.4215
first,SANDERS,Now I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And as president I suspect it will be an F record. What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA.,0.049,0.951,0,-0.296
first,SANDERS,You asked me about my record. Back in 1988 coming from a state that had no gun control I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA but to expand and create universal background checks do away with the strawman provision do away with the gun show loophole and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.,0.193,0.753,0.053,-0.8922
first,LEMON,Yeah. Mayor Buttigieg your response. ,0,0.645,0.355,0.296
first,BUTTIGIEG,Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money out of politics. But when I propose the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference end the Electoral College amend the Constitution if necessary to clear up Citizens United have D.C. actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform people look at me funny as if this country were incapable of structural reform. ,0.031,0.828,0.141,0.8519
first,BUTTIGIEG,Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.,0,0.928,0.072,0.4215

first,LEMON,Ms. Williamson how do you respond to this issue of gun safety?,0.158,0.658,0.184,0.1027
first,WILLIAMSON,The issue of gun safety of course is that the NRA has us in a chokehold but so do the pharmaceutical companies so do the health insurance companies so do the fossil fuel companies and so do the defense contractors and none of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns. ,0.027,0.91,0.063,0.3282
first,WILLIAMSON,But for politicians including my fellow candidates who themselves have taken tens of thousands  and in some cases hundreds of thousands  of dollars from these same corporate donors to think that they now have the moral authority to say we're going to take them on I don't think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada yada yada.,0,0.908,0.092,0.5994
first,WILLIAMSON,It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority: That is over. We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns. That's what we need to stand up to.,0,0.973,0.027,0.0772

first,SANDERS,And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly is that he is a fraud and a phony and we're going to expose him for what he is. The American people want to have a minimum wage which is a living wage $15 an hour. I've helped lead that effort.,0.199,0.779,0.022,-0.8807

first,RYAN,Now in this discussion already tonight we've talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial Midwest we've talked about decriminalizing the border and we've talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many Americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare.,0.078,0.816,0.106,0.3612
first,RYAN,I quite frankly don't think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win. We've got to talk about the working class issues the people that take a shower after work who haven't had a raise in 30 years,0,0.911,0.089,0.5859
first,TAPPER,Thank you  thank you Congressman ,0,0.375,0.625,0.6124

first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman I want to bring Congressman O'Rourke your response sir? ,0,0.703,0.297,0.4215
first,O'ROURKE,Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete  there is a new battleground state Texas and it has 38 electoral college votes. And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties. No matter how red or rural we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban  we did not take you for granted. ,0.125,0.791,0.084,-0.6369
first,O'ROURKE,And we didn't trim our sails either. We had the courage of our convictions talking about universal health care comprehensive immigration reform and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late. We brought everyone in,0.037,0.739,0.224,0.7964
first,TAPPER,Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
first,O'ROURKE, and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump with Texas. ,0,0.833,0.167,0.25
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. I want to bring in Governor Bullock. We're talking about whether Democrats are moving too far to the left to win the White House. President Trump won your home state of Montana by 20 points. How do you respond sir? BULLOCK: Yeah as the only one of the field of 37 that actually won a Trump state  25 percent to 30 percent of my voters voted for Donald Trump  I know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those Trump voters back if we're ever going to win. ,0.02,0.762,0.217,0.9702
first,TAPPER,But this isn't just a choice between the left and the center. It's not a choice just between sort of these wish list economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win. What folks want is a fair shot. The way I won the way we can win is to actually focus on the economy and the democracy aren't working for most people.,0,0.737,0.263,0.9584
first,TAPPER,Thank you Governor.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,BULLOCK,That's how I win. That's how we can take back the office.,0,0.725,0.275,0.5859
first,TAPPER,Thank you Governor. Senator Warren you make it a point to say that you're a capitalist. Is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than Senator Sanders?,0,0.771,0.229,0.7906
first,WARREN,No. It is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street and CEOs and their lobbyists and their lawyers and I beat them. I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator and I beat him. ,0.087,0.794,0.119,0.4215
first,WARREN,I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected. Shoot I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected. But here's where we are.,0,0.919,0.081,0.2584
first,WARREN,I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.,0.124,0.876,0,-0.7003
first,WARREN,Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for Democrats to win you can't be afraid either.,0.068,0.733,0.199,0.7184
first,TAPPER,Congressman Delaney your response? ,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,So  so I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions not impossible promises when we run on things that are workable not fairy tale economics.,0.071,0.743,0.186,0.5544
first,DELANEY,Look at the story of Detroit this amazing city that we're in. This city is turning around because the government and the private sector are working well together. That has to be our model going forward. We need to encourage collaboration between the government the private sector and the nonprofit sector and focus on those kitchen table pocketbook issues that matter to hard-working Americans: building infrastructure creating jobs improving their pay,0.017,0.786,0.197,0.9274

first,DELANEY,We can do it. ,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,You know I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for. ,0.074,0.791,0.136,0.3147
first,WARREN,I don't get it.,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption. It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat. And we need to have the courage to fight back against that. And until we're ready to do that it's just more of the same.,0.095,0.804,0.102,0.1027
first,WARREN,Well I'm ready to get in this fight. I'm ready to win this fight.,0.241,0.321,0.438,0.5994
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. Congressman Delaney?,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,DELANEY,When we created Social Security we didn't say pensions were illegal right? We can have big ideas to transform the lives. I mean I started two companies and took them public before I was 40. I'm as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone.,0.077,0.83,0.094,-0.0516
first,DELANEY,But I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable. Can you imagine if we tried to start Social Security now but said private pensions are illegal? That's the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with health care. That's not a big idea. That's an idea that's dead on arrival. That will never happen. So why don't we actually talk about things big ideas that we can get done? The stakes are too high.,0.122,0.797,0.08,-0.782
first,TAPPER,Thank you Congressman. Senator Warren?,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612

first,TAPPER,We'll come to you right after that. ,0,1,0,0
first,TAPPER,Senator Warren?,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,He talks about solutions that are workable. We have tried the solution of Medicare Medicaid and private insurance. And what have the private insurance companies done? They've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system. They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because they're trying to track your health care. They just want one more excuse to say no. Insurance companies do not have a God-given right to suck money out of our health care system. ,0.084,0.743,0.174,0.7752
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders? ,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,SANDERS,Detroit was mentioned. And I'm delighted that Detroit is rebounding. But let us understand Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low-wage countries. ,0.128,0.804,0.068,-0.4404
first,SANDERS,To win this election and to defeat Donald Trump  which by the way in my view is not going to be easy  we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision. We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen by among other things making public colleges,0.042,0.761,0.197,0.875
first,TAPPER,Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

first,TAPPER,"I want to bring in  I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar. At the beginning of the night you said you're going to hear a lot of promises on the stage. And previously you have said when asked about your primary opponents quote ""A lot of people are making promises and I'm not going to make promises just to get elected."" Who on this stage is making promises just to get elected?",0,0.829,0.171,0.875
first,KLOBUCHAR,Everyone wants to get elected. But my point is this: I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10000 lies that we'd better be very straightforward with the American people.,0.071,0.856,0.073,0.0258
first,KLOBUCHAR,And no do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No I don't think we're going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see which is lower costs for health care.,0.105,0.778,0.117,0.2023
first,KLOBUCHAR,Do I think that we're going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No I don't think we're going to do that. So that's what I'm talking about.,0.063,0.749,0.187,0.6486
first,KLOBUCHAR,But what I don't like about this argument right now what I don't like about it at all is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election.,0.279,0.547,0.174,-0.3369
first,KLOBUCHAR,And I think how we win an election is to bring everyone with us. And yes I have won in a state every single time statewide. I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. He just targeted Minnesota last week. And I have done it by getting out there and talking to people by knowing rural issues and farm issues,0,0.761,0.239,0.9559

first,TAPPER,I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke. Congressman O'Rourke please respond. ,0,0.69,0.31,0.3818
first,O'ROURKE,You know I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress when I learned that the El Paso V.A. had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied and was related to the suicide epidemic we made it our priority and we turned around the V.A. in El Paso. ,0.149,0.699,0.152,-0.1779
first,O'ROURKE,We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand medical health care to veterans and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing  Donald Trump  to show that at the end of the day we will put the American people first,0,0.864,0.136,0.7906

first,BASH,Thank you Congressman O'Rourke. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,BASH,We've been asking voters to weigh in on what they'd most like to hear Democrats debate. Among the topics they told us they're most interested in the climate crisis.,0.114,0.725,0.161,0.1744
first,BASH,Congressman Delaney I'll start with you. You say the Green New Deal is about as realistic as Trump saying Mexico is going to pay for the wall. But scientists say we need essentially to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050 to avoid the most catastrophic consequences. Why isn't this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic?,0.21,0.79,0,-0.9152
first,DELANEY,Well first of all because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate like universal health care guaranteed government jobs and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.,0,0.757,0.243,0.8625
first,DELANEY,My plan which gets us to net zero by 2050 which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids will get us there. I put a price on carbon take all the money give it back to the American people in a dividend. That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis. It's the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress.,0,0.971,0.029,0.2023
first,DELANEY,I'm going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem. I'm going to create a market for something called direct air capture which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because I don't think we'll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things. I'm going to increase investment in renewables and I'm going to create something called the Climate Corps.,0.035,0.805,0.16,0.8391
first,DELANEY,That is a plan that's realistic. It's a bet on the U.S. private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to net zero by 2050 for our kids.,0,0.781,0.219,0.7184
first,BASH,Thank you. Thank you Congressman. Senator Warren you're a cosponsor of the Green New Deal. Your response to Congressman Delaney?,0,0.773,0.227,0.6124
first,WARREN,So climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best and that is innovate and create. ,0.18,0.63,0.191,-0.0917
first,WARREN,So I've proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan right here in Ohio right here in the industrial Midwest.,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world. Right now for every $1 the United States,0,0.899,0.101,0.4215

first,BASH,Governor Hickenlooper you take issue with the green new deal (ph). Please respond.,0,0.839,0.161,0.3182
first,HICKENLOOPER,Well I think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem. It's a distraction. ,0.209,0.63,0.161,-0.296
first,HICKENLOOPER,I share the urgency of everyone up here. We have to recognize  I mean everyone's got good ideas. What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice right? It's what we do here is a best practice and a template but it's got to be done all over the world.,0.028,0.782,0.19,0.7964
first,HICKENLOOPER,So we've got to be building bridges right now with people like China who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property. We need to work on that but not with a tariff system. We need every country working together if we're going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.,0.081,0.823,0.095,-0.0516
first,BASH,Thank you. Senator Warren your response?,0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
first,WARREN,"Look I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing. There's going to be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country. And no one wants to talk about it. What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say ""Oh we don't really have to do anything.""",0.029,0.895,0.076,0.3612

first,WARREN,It continues to be a Washington that works great for oil companies just not for people worried about climate change.,0,0.74,0.26,0.7174

first,BASH,Senator Sanders is co-sponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas-powered car sales by 2040. Given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state how concerned are you about Senator Sanders' plan?,0,0.96,0.04,0.0772
first,RYAN,Well if we get our act together we won't have to worry about it. I  my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again that would pull the government the Department of Energy Department of Transportation work with the private sector work with investors emerging tech companies to dominate the electric vehicle market. ,0.021,0.814,0.164,0.8404
first,RYAN,China dominates it now 50 percent to 60 percent. I want us to dominate the battery market make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal. The charging stations solar panels same thing; China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.,0.07,0.802,0.127,0.2263
first,RYAN,So this person will work in the White House report directly to me and we're going to start making things again.,0,1,0,0
first,RYAN,But you cannot get there on climate unless we talk about agriculture. We need to convert our industrial agriculture system over to a sustainable and regenerative agriculture system,0,1,0,0
first,RYAN,KLOBUCHAR (?): I agree.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,RYAN, that actually sequesters carbon,0,1,0,0
first,RYAN,into the soil. And you can go ask  you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture. So we can move away,0,1,0,0
first,RYAN,from all the subsidies that we're giving the farmers. They haven't made a profit in five years. And we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities. And that's going to drive health care down. That's another part of the health care conversation,0.044,0.744,0.212,0.8517
first,BASH,Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612

first,BASH,Thank you. Senator Sanders your response? ,0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
first,SANDERS,I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas. They could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations. They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street. So please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry. And nothing happens unless we do that. ,0.04,0.875,0.084,0.4351
first,SANDERS,"Here is the bottom line. We've got to ask ourselves a simple question ""What do you do with an industry that knowingly for billions of dollars in short-term profits is destroying this planet?"" I say that is criminal activity that cannot be allowed to continue.",0.14,0.802,0.058,-0.6249

first,RYAN,All I'm saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing. And if we're waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles we're screwed. So we better get busy now. And that's why I'm saying get a chief manufacturing officer align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward.,0.083,0.794,0.123,0.3134
first,RYAN,And then here's what I'll do as president,0,1,0,0
first,BASH,Thank you Congressman.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,RYAN, cut the worker in on the deal. Make sure these are union jobs. And I will double union membership to make sure these new jobs pay what the old fossil fuel jobs pay. ,0.134,0.74,0.126,0.1779

first,SANDERS,On this issue my friends there is no choice. We have got to be super aggressive if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable so I don't disagree with Tim.

first,BULLOCK,And second of which as we transition to this clean energy economy you've got to recognize there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country and far too often Democrats sound like they're part of the problem. We got to make sure to aid in those transition as we get to a carbon neutral world which I think we can do by 2020.,0.038,0.823,0.14,0.745

first,BULLOCK,Who - oh no I - I think Democrats often when they're saying oh these fossil fuel industries these workers those coal miner workers. Look the world's changing. We got to make a change but I think Democrats often sound like the people that as Congressman Ryan would say shower at the end of the day that they're part of the problem.

first,SANDERS,Look Steve there ain't nobody in the Congress who's more strongly pro-worker than I am. So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry what I am also talking about is a just transition. All right. We can create what the Green New Deal is about. It's a bold idea. We can create millions of good-paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker. We are going to provide and make sure that those workers have a transition new jobs healthcare and education.,0.041,0.841,0.118,0.6697

first,BASH,Kimber (ph),0,1,0,0
first,BASH,"from Birmingham Michigan has this question ""what is your plan to address infrastructure including the water issue so another Flint Michigan does not happen again?""",0,1,0,0
first,KLOBUCHAR,Thank you Dana and I was just in Flint. And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous. So my plan and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. It's a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams. ,0.047,0.913,0.039,-0.128
first,KLOBUCHAR,"I think the Governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan ""fix the damn roads"" and it is an issue for union jobs. And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that's promised he was going to do that on election night if anyone remembers. And then he hasn't followed through  he has done nothing he blew up a meeting at the White House.",0.038,0.893,0.07,0.3182
first,KLOBUCHAR,I would put $1 trillion in to this and I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised.,0.021,0.733,0.245,0.926
first,KLOBUCHAR,And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood the African neighborhood  that was African-American neighborhood that was most-hit when you had those recent rainstorms.,0,1,0,0

first,WILLIAMSON,We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act. We have communities particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.,0.242,0.689,0.069,-0.7783
first,WILLIAMSON,I assure you I lived Grosse Pointe  what happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.

first,WILLIAMSON,We need to say it like it is it's bigger than Flint  it's all over this country it's particularly people of color  it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back. And if the Democrats don't start saying it then why would those people feel that they're there for us and if those people don't feel it they won't vote for us and Donald Trump will win.,0.034,0.883,0.083,0.5719

first,LEMON,We want to turn now to the issue of race in America. Congressman O'Rourke President Trump is pursuing a reelection strategy based in part on racial division. How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America? ,0,0.862,0.138,0.7579
first,O'ROURKE,"We'll call his racism out for what it is and also talk about its consequences. It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say ""send her back"" about a member of Congress because she's a woman color because she's a Muslim-American doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants ""rapists and criminals"" or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that's comprised of people from the world over from every tradition of faith.

first,O'ROURKE,So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election but we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences but we embrace them.

first,HICKENLOOPER,Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union that all people are created equal. And we've fallen far away from that. I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools. ,0.038,0.722,0.241,0.9099
first,HICKENLOOPER,In Colorado when I was Mayor we got universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city. We did major police reform 10 years before Ferguson  why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything?,0,1,0,0
first,HICKENLOOPER,How do we get affordable housing? We created a scholarship fund for every kid  you've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.,0,0.764,0.236,0.6705
first,LEMON,Thank you Governor. Senator Warren I'm coming to you now. Last week the FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year have been motivated by white supremacy. In fact the alleged shooter in this weekend's attack in Gilroy California referenced a well-known white supremacist book on social media. How are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy?,0.134,0.742,0.125,-0.5719
first,WARREN,We need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism. And it poses a threat to the United States of America.,0.258,0.613,0.129,-0.7184
first,WARREN,We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism economic racism criminal justice racism health care racism. The way we do better is to fight back and show something better.,0.388,0.398,0.215,-0.9001
first,WARREN,So I have a plan for example on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race. So my plan has universal tuition-free college for all of our kids but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.,0,0.901,0.099,0.6705
first,WARREN,It cancels student loan debt for 95 percent of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.,0.218,0.599,0.183,-0.0258
first,LEMON,Thank you Senator very much. ,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,LEMON,Mayor Buttigieg you have been criticized for your handling of racial issues in your home city of South Bend from diversity in the police force to housing policy. Given your record how can you convince African-Americans that you should be the Democratic nominee?,0.055,0.901,0.044,-0.128
first,BUTTIGIEG,As an urban mayor serving a diverse community the racial divide lives within me. I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch. ,0.295,0.705,0,-0.8979
first,BUTTIGIEG,But in our city we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested African-American neighborhood.,0.052,0.859,0.088,0.1386
first,BUTTIGIEG,Right now in the wake of a police-involved shooting our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.,0.048,0.758,0.194,0.743
first,BUTTIGIEG,I've proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action.,0,1,0,0
first,BUTTIGIEG,Systemic racism has touched every part of American life from housing to health to homeownership.

first,LEMON,Senator Klobuchar what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry?,0,1,0,0
first,KLOBUCHAR,Well first of all there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist; they just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so I would appeal to them. ,0.047,0.724,0.229,0.7594
first,KLOBUCHAR,But I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend turned on the TV and saw their president calling their city the town of Baltimore nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you as your president that will stop.,0.044,0.956,0,-0.296
first,KLOBUCHAR,The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place yes we help the African-American community and we must because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decades but we help everyone.,0.038,0.784,0.178,0.8766
first,KLOBUCHAR,So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state just like I say to them in the city and bring them together is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.,0,0.858,0.142,0.6486
first,LEMON,Senator Klobuchar thank you very much. ,0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
first,LEMON,Congressman O'Rourke please respond.,0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
first,O'ROURKE,I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on which is the very foundation of this country the wealth that we have built the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force. ,0.021,0.826,0.153,0.8176
first,O'ROURKE,The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country.,0.152,0.698,0.149,-0.2732
first,O'ROURKE,Today as president I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act. I will focus on education address health care disparities but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we've waited too long in this country to have.,0,0.956,0.044,0.2732
first,LEMON,Thank you Congressman O'Rourke. Speaking of reparations Ms. Williamson many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery. But you are calling for up to $500 billion in financial assistance. What makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations?,0.089,0.815,0.096,-0.1531
first,WILLIAMSON,Well first of all it's not $500 billion in financial assistance. It's $500 billion $200 billion to $500 billion payment of a debt that is owed. That is what reparations is. ,0.077,0.859,0.064,-0.1027
first,WILLIAMSON,We need some deep truth-telling when it comes. We don't need another commission to look at evidence. I appreciate what Congressman O'Rourke has said. It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal.,0,0.93,0.07,0.4019
first,WILLIAMSON,All that a country is is a collection of people. People heal when there's some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with.,0.073,0.846,0.081,0.1027
first,WILLIAMSON,That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another hundred years of domestic terrorism.,0.343,0.55,0.107,-0.875
first,WILLIAMSON,What makes me qualified to say $200 billion to $500 billion? I'll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule given that there was 4 million to 5 million slaves at the end of the Civil War four to five  and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four if you did the math today it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult.,0.079,0.893,0.028,-0.6908
first,WILLIAMSON,And I believe that $200 billion to $500 billion is politically feasible today because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.,0.092,0.868,0.04,-0.4767
first,LEMON,Thank you very much. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,LEMON,Senator Sanders  Senator Sanders you don't think cash payments are the best way to address this issue but according to a new Gallup poll 73 percent of African-Americans are in favor of cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. How do you respond to them?,0,0.88,0.12,0.7311
first,SANDERS,Well I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation which is called 10-20-30. And what that understands is that as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in health care in education in financial services we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America including African-American communities. ,0.156,0.745,0.1,-0.7351
first,SANDERS,In terms of education I also have a plan. It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan. And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for Title I schools. It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60000 a year.,0,0.902,0.098,0.5994
first,LEMON,Senator Sanders thank you very much. The debate continues right after this short break. ,0,0.839,0.161,0.3612
first,LEMON,Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Detroit. ,0,0.769,0.231,0.4588
first,LEMON,Let's turn now to the economy.,0,1,0,0
first,LEMON,Congressman Ryan President Trump's tariffs have boosted the U.S. steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan which could drive up the cost of cars. As president would you continue President Trump's steel tariffs?,0.106,0.78,0.115,-0.1531
first,RYAN,Look I think President Trump was onto something when he talked about China. China has been abusing the economic system for a long time. They steal intellectual property. They subsidize goods coming into this country. They've displaced steel workers auto workers across the board eroded our manufacturing. And we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top 1 percent or to China for them to build their military. ,0.078,0.818,0.104,0.2732
first,RYAN,So I think we need some targeted response against China. But you know how you beat China? You out-compete 'em. And that's why I'd put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base.,0,0.941,0.059,0.3182
first,RYAN,We've got to fill these factories that  in Detroit in Youngstown that used to make cars and steel. We've got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles batteries charging stations make sure they're making solar panels.,0,0.943,0.057,0.3182
first,RYAN,As I said earlier China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market. They dominate 50 percent to 60 percent of the electric vehicle market. We're going to make 10 million electric vehicle somewhere in the world in the next 10 years. I want them made in the United States. That's why I have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the White House and help drive this agenda.,0.021,0.865,0.113,0.6705
first,LEMON,Congressman thank you. Just as a point of clarification as president would you consider President Trump's steel tariffs yes or no? ,0.09,0.697,0.213,0.4588
first,RYAN,Well I would have to re-evaluate. I think some of them are effective. But he's bungled the whole thing obviously. He has  see here's the problem with President Trump. He has a tactical move  one of many  he has a tactical move. What's the grand strategy for the United States? China has 100-year plan a 50-year plan a 30-year plan a 20-year plan. We live in a 24-hour news cycle. That spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics. ,0.123,0.754,0.124,-0.2263
first,LEMON,Thank you Congressman. Congressman Delaney your response?,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
first,DELANEY,So listen. This is what I don't understand. President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants. Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama. I'm the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama was right about that. We should be getting back in that. ,0,0.899,0.101,0.7269

first,LEMON,Thank you Congressman Delaney. Senator Warren please respond. ,0,0.556,0.444,0.5859
first,WARREN,You know for decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multi-national corporations to help giant multi-national corporations. They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico they'll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam they'll do it in a heartbeat. ,0.061,0.808,0.131,0.7184
first,WARREN,I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way. We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table with small businesses at the table with small farmers at the table with environmentalists at the table with human rights activists at the table. And then we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets. They want to sell to you,0,0.957,0.043,0.3182

first,LEMON,Congressman Delaney it's your turn. Thank you Senator. Congressman Delaney?,0,0.783,0.217,0.3612
first,DELANEY,So that was the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think President Obama was right. He did include environmental standards. He did include labor standards. We would be in an entirely different position with China if we had entered the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ,0,1,0,0
first,DELANEY,We can't isolate ourselves from the world. We can't isolate ourselves from Asia. Senator Warren's plan basically that she put out we would not be able to trade with the United Kingdom.,0,0.829,0.171,0.6103
first,WARREN,No what this is about,0.355,0.645,0,-0.296

first,SANDERS,Oh I'm sorry. ,0.394,0.606,0,-0.0772
first,WARREN,What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs and we can build the trade deals that do it. ,0,0.962,0.038,0.0772
first,WARREN,People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is let's make them raise their standards. Make them pay workers more. Let their workers unionize. Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products.,0.028,0.92,0.052,0.0516
first,WARREN,Right now the whole game is working for the big multinationals. It's just not working for the people here in the United States and we can change that.,0,0.906,0.094,0.4215
first,LEMON,Senator thank you very much. Congressman O'Rourke your response?,0,0.762,0.238,0.3612
first,O'ROURKE,You know the question was about tariffs. And they're a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences. ,0.136,0.777,0.087,-0.3804
first,O'ROURKE,When have we ever gone to war including a trade war without allies and friends and partners? As president we will hold China accountable but we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear and we'll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor not just here in the United States,0.124,0.705,0.172,0.7088

first,SANDERS,Yeah OK. You're looking I believe at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements NAFTA PNTR with China which cost us over 4 million jobs but also helped lead the effort against these agreements. ,0.055,0.769,0.176,0.5133
first,SANDERS,Now Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker you're mistaken. If they can save five cents by going to China Mexico or Vietnam or anyplace else that's exactly what they will do.,0.105,0.83,0.065,-0.25
first,SANDERS,As president let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts. They want all kinds of contracts. Well under my administration you ain't going to get those contracts if you're throwing American workers out on the street.,0,0.903,0.097,0.4019

first,HICKENLOOPER,The bottom line is you talk to any economist there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers. And the bottom line is we've got to recognize let's negotiate a better trade deal. But you're not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25 percent of our total debt.,0.258,0.658,0.085,-0.9283
first,HICKENLOOPER,And step back and look it. Here's Trump gives a giant tax cut and at the same time  so we're paying in tariffs about $800 to $1200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich. Essentially what's happening is now he's transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class. That's what's outrageous. But tariffs are not the solution.,0.131,0.817,0.052,-0.5517
first,LEMON,Governor thank you. Senator Warren?,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
first,WARREN,Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians Americans and Mexicans more money and make more profits. ,0,0.893,0.107,0.7089
first,WARREN,That's what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.,0.128,0.754,0.118,0.1102

first,BULLOCK,But by the same token what we have is  I actually agree with Senator Warren on this in part. Corporations can move capital easy. Workers can't move. So going forward we need to make sure that our trade deals actually are protecting  thinking about the workers. They can't be the stepchild. But the way to do it with this blunt instrument of tariffs that the president is doing that's not how we get a fair deal for farmers anywhere or the manufacturers here in Detroit.,0,0.888,0.112,0.8402

Mayor Buttigieg on Thursday of this week a GM plant in Michigan will stop production the latest auto plant to cease operations in the industrial Midwest. This comes as part of the company's modernization plans which will eventually result in 6000 hourly workers losing their jobs or being reassigned to other plants.,0.071,0.827,0.102,0.2732

first,BUTTIGIEG,Well this happened in my community 20 years before I was born. And when I was growing up we were still picking up the pieces. Empty factories empty houses poverty. I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place. And there will be more. ,0.139,0.785,0.076,-0.4767
first,BUTTIGIEG,It's why we actually need to put the interests of workers first. Of course we need to do retraining. We're doing it now in South Bend. We should continue to do it. But this is so much bigger than a trade fight. This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes.,0.047,0.917,0.036,-0.1531
first,BUTTIGIEG,There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week than my parents went through in their lifetime. It's why I've proposed that we allow gig workers to unionize because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.,0,0.955,0.045,0.2263
first,LEMON,Thank you Mayor. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,BUTTIGIEG,We have to respond to all of these changes. And you know in addition to confronting tech in addition to supporting workers by double unionization as I propose to do some of this is low-tech too like the minimum wage is just too low. And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage when scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker. ,0.116,0.817,0.067,-0.4588

first,LEMON,Congressman Delaney I'm coming to you now. Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million. That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75000 homes households or so in the United States. Do you think Senator Warren's wealth tax is a fair way to fund child care and education?,0,0.695,0.305,0.9636
first,DELANEY,I think wealthy Americans have to pay more. Listen I grew up in a blue-collar family. First in my family to go to college. Became a successful entrepreneur. Created thousands of jobs. Supported thousands of entrepreneurs all around this country. And I've done well financially. I think I should pay more in tax. I think wealthy Americans should pay more in tax. But we have to have a real solution. ,0.057,0.706,0.237,0.9231
first,DELANEY,The real solution is to raise the capital gains rates. There is no reason why people who invest for a living should pay less than people who work for a living. That's ridiculous. It's the biggest loophole in our tax code.,0.136,0.759,0.105,-0.1027
first,DELANEY,We act like wealthy individuals are endangered species and if we don't raise  if we raise their taxes they won't invest. That's crazy. That's how we get more revenues from wealthy individuals we roll back the Trump tax cuts to wealthy individuals.,0.044,0.717,0.24,0.8332
first,DELANEY,I think the wealth tax will be fought in court forever. It's arguably unconstitutional. And the countries that have had it have largely abandoned it because it's impossible to implement. But here again real solutions not impossible promises.,0.209,0.683,0.108,-0.555

first,WARREN,So I have proposed a wealth tax. It's now time to do that. It's time to tax the top one tenth of one percent of fortunes in this country. Your first $50 million you can keep free and clear. But your 50 millionth and first dollar you got to pitch in two cents. Two cents. ,0,0.814,0.186,0.8797
first,WARREN,What can America do with two cents? We can provide universal childcare from zero to five. We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. We can provide universal tuition-free college. We can expand Pell. We can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America.,0.048,0.894,0.059,0.25

first,DELANEY,This is not about whether wealthy  this is not about whether wealthy Americans should pay more. I think we're all in agreement on that. It's a question of do you have a real solution to make it happen?,0.137,0.73,0.134,0.2216
first,DELANEY,We can raise the capital gains rate to match the ordinary income. You know the last president to do that was actually Ronald Reagan. We can do that in our first year. I've called for that to be done (inaudible). I've called for the expansion of universal pre-K so that every American has pre-K. And I do it through a  through an additional tax on high net worth individuals.,0,0.938,0.062,0.5106

first,SANDERS,Can I just respond to that?,0,1,0,0
first,BASH,I'm going to turn to the issue of student debt now. Mayor Buttigieg you've talked about how you and your husband are,0.106,0.894,0,-0.3612
first,BASH,paying down six figures of student loan debt. Under Senator Sanders' proposal to cancel all student loan debt yours would immediately be wiped away. Why wouldn't you support that?,0.27,0.73,0,-0.8052
first,BUTTIGIEG,That would be great for us. And then the next day there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't  why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs wiped away completely too. ,0.05,0.861,0.088,0.4153
first,BUTTIGIEG,We can have debt-free college for low and middle-income students by expanding Pell Grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden. And on the back end for those of us who do have a lot of debt we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.,0.095,0.759,0.146,0.483
first,BUTTIGIEG,We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair. If we want to start wiping away student debt here's where I would start. I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people especially veterans by the way. The moment I redeployed my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama they were held accountable for whether they delivered results. President Trump under a secretary of education who regrettably is from this state did away with those rules. There's no accountability.,0.08,0.862,0.058,-0.4767

first,SANDERS,Matter of fact I do. But before I get into that the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress; you don't talk about in the media is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America. ,0,0.891,0.109,0.5106
first,SANDERS,You've got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. You have a top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. Forty-nine percent of all new (ph),0,0.767,0.233,0.831
first,SANDERS,income goes to the top 1 percent. Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax. And we've got 500000 people sleeping out on the street.,0,0.793,0.207,0.6481

first,WILLIAMSON,I'd like to respond.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,BASH,You are proposing to make college free for all qualified students. Should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college? ,0.048,0.727,0.225,0.7269
first,WILLIAMSON,I think that all domestic and international policy should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy. That's how you stimulate your economy. So if a few people take advantage but there are four or five people who were going to take the money that they then have in the bank  when you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt  this is why I agree with Bernie or I would be  OK why don't we swap it? We had a $2 trillion tax cut where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very very richest among us that does not stimulate the economy. ,0.047,0.796,0.157,0.9162
first,WILLIAMSON,If we get rid of this college debt think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending; they'll be able to start their business. The best thing you could do to stimulate the U.S. economy is to get rid of this debt.,0.096,0.787,0.117,0.2732
first,WILLIAMSON,This is not just about a plan to to do it. It's about a philosophy of governing. And I've heard some people here tonight I almost wonder why you're Democrats. You seem to think there's something wrong about using,0.081,0.919,0,-0.4767
first,WILLIAMSON,about using the instruments of government to help people. That is what government should do. It should  all policies should help people thrive. That is how we will have peace,0,0.752,0.248,0.836

first,O'ROURKE,I support free two-year college earn that associate's degree realize your full potential debt-free four-year college. But unlike some of the other candidates on the stage that's not just for tuition. That is room and books and board the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country and then for that schoolteacher who in many places like Texas is working a second or a third job full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt forgiveness for that person willing to work at the V.A. and serve our former service members. ,0.023,0.773,0.205,0.9584
first,O'ROURKE,And we do not do that at the expense of unions. We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life.,0,0.835,0.165,0.7269
first,BASH,Thank you. Thank you Congressman. Senator Klobuchar your response? ,0,0.583,0.417,0.6124
first,KLOBUCHAR,I want to make it easier for kids to go to college. And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids for Wall Street kids to go to college. There's no difference. It says everyone is free. ,0.096,0.76,0.145,0.5165
first,KLOBUCHAR,I don't think that makes sense. And I'm very concerned if we do things like that the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation. So what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally  over 5 10 years  can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers.,0.049,0.806,0.145,0.8316

And I don't think  I mean we have troops in over 400 different locations around the world. Most of them are small they're peacekeeping they're not greatly at risk. ,0.138,0.783,0.079,-0.5831

first,TAPPER,Thank you Governor. Thank you Governor.,0,0.444,0.556,0.6124
first,TAPPER,Senator Warren you want to make it U.S. policy that the U.S. will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first. Now President Obama reportedly considered that policy but ultimately decided against it. Why should the U.S. tie its own hands with that policy?,0,0.944,0.056,0.1516
first,WARREN,Because it makes the world safer. The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively and we need to say so to the entire world. It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculates someone misunderstands. ,0.121,0.748,0.131,0.1027
first,WARREN,Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe. And what's happening right now with Donald Trump is they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons the different ways that they could be used puts us all at risk.,0.109,0.828,0.063,-0.2732
first,WARREN,You know we talk about what's happening around the world. I have three older brothers who served in the military. I see that they would do anything. Our military is the best on Earth. But we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution. We need to use our diplomatic tools our economic tools and if we're going to send someone into war we better have a plan for how we're going to get them out on the other end.,0.062,0.862,0.076,0.3045

first,BULLOCK,I wouldn't want to take that off the table. I think America's strength  we have to be able to say that. Look never I hope certainly in my term or anyone else would we really even get close to pulling that trigger.,0.129,0.798,0.073,-0.119
first,BULLOCK,But by the same token America's strength  and look this president has made America first as America alone. Our allies no longer trust us. Our adversaries are with us. But going from the position of strength we should be negotiating down so there aren't nuclear weapons. But drawing those lines in the sand at this point I wouldn't do.,0.089,0.736,0.175,0.7849
first,LEMON,Thank you Governor. Senator Warren. your response?,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
first,WARREN,"Look we don't expand trust around the world by saying ""You know we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon."" That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world has pulled us out of the deal in Iran and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare. ",0.137,0.836,0.027,-0.8255
first,BULLOCK,Senator that,0,1,0,0
first,WARREN,We have to have an announced policy that is one the entire world can live with. We need to make that clear. We will respond if someone else does but not first. ,0,0.945,0.055,0.2023
first,LEMON,Governor Bullock please respond. ,0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
first,BULLOCK,Part I agree with. But by the same token like we need to get back to nuclear proliferation. ,0,0.75,0.25,0.6124
first,WARREN,Why?,0,1,0,0
first,BULLOCK,"But when you have folks  de-proliferation reducing it. But at the same time when you actually have Korea; when you have others I don't want to turn around and say ""Well Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that."" When so many crazy folks are getting closer to having a nuclear weapon I don't want them to think I could strike this country and I and we as the United States of America wouldn't do a thing.

first,SANDERS,Could I add something to that,0,1,0,0
first,LEMON,Senator please  moving on now. As you know to serve as president of the United States  all of you know this  you have to be at least 35 years old. ,0,0.846,0.154,0.6249
first,LEMON,So Mayor Buttigieg you just qualified. You're 37 the youngest candidate in this field. Standing next to you is the oldest candidate Bernie Sanders at age 77. Should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate?,0,1,0,0
first,BUTTIGIEG,I don't care how old you are. I care about your vision. But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world leaders like the,0.147,0.697,0.156,-0.167
first,BUTTIGIEG,I actually think it's good that the prime minister of New Zealand's gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates. She's masterful. She is younger than I would be when I take office.,0,0.906,0.094,0.4404
first,BUTTIGIEG,This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following but only if it's actually backed by the right vision. And we can have great presidents at any age. What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work. We have to be ready to take on this president and by the way something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight take on his enablers in Congress.,0,0.8,0.2,0.9711
first,BUTTIGIEG,You know when,0,1,0,0
first,BUTTIGIEG,when David Duke  when David Duke ran for Congress  ran for governor the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him. Today they are supporting naked racism in the White House or at best silent about it. And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.,0.057,0.802,0.141,0.875
first,LEMON,Thank you Mayor. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
first,LEMON,Senator Sanders as the senior statesman of the group please respond to Mayor Buttigieg.,0,0.85,0.15,0.3182
first,SANDERS,Well Pete is right. It's a question of vision. That's what it is whether you're young whether you're old whether you're in between. And my vision among other things says that if we're going to fight for health care we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. ,0.046,0.791,0.163,0.6908
first,SANDERS,And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who in my view are going to war against the American people in terms of health care. That's a new vision.,0.129,0.761,0.11,-0.2225
first,SANDERS,A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today for the first time in modern American history will have a lower standard of living than their parents.,0.175,0.775,0.05,-0.6096
first,LEMON,Thank you Senator Sanders. ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612

first,LEMON,Thank you. The debate continues right after this short break. ,0,0.783,0.217,0.3612
first,TAPPER,Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debates. We have covered a lot of ground tonight. Now it is time for closing statements. You will each receive one minute. ,0,0.9,0.1,0.4588
first,TAPPER,Governor Bullock we're going to begin with you.,0,1,0,0
first,BULLOCK,Thanks Jake. ,0,0.256,0.744,0.4404
first,BULLOCK,I was raised in a single-parent household at times paycheck to paycheck. Only knew there was a governor's house in town because I delivered newspapers to it so I've made it about four blocks in life. Worked my way through college paid my way through law school.,0.043,0.957,0,-0.2263
first,BULLOCK,But you know I had a chance to actually go from delivering newspapers to the governor's house as a kid to now raising our three kids in it. We got to recognize for far too many people now in America that shot no longer exists. And for far too many in this country it never has.,0.04,0.924,0.036,-0.0516
first,BULLOCK,I'm running for president to beat Donald Trump win back the places we lost and make sure that Americans know that where Washington has left them behind in the economy in the political system I'll be there.,0.054,0.802,0.144,0.5859
first,BULLOCK,This isn't a choice just between center and left or about  we don't have to choose between what we don't want and what we can't afford. Folks want a different way. They want to believe the economy and our democracy can work for us. That's why I'm running for president.,0.075,0.925,0,-0.1695
first,TAPPER,Thank you. Ms. Williamson?,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
first,WILLIAMSON,Yes our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump. We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred collectivized hatred and white nationalism. ,0.375,0.505,0.12,-0.891
first,WILLIAMSON,And in order to do that we need more than political insider game and wonkiness and intellectual argument. Those things will not defeat Donald Trump. We need some radical truth-telling not just to talk about health care but talk about why are we so sick all the time. We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed.,0.124,0.741,0.135,-0.0572
first,WILLIAMSON,Even on the subject of foreign policy it's all about symptoms and not about cause. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership. The fact that countries see us not only domestically but internationally with policies that simply support our corporate overlords. The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace-building.,0,0.831,0.169,0.9041
first,WILLIAMSON,There's some corruption that is so deep ladies and gentlemen. And until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to the deeper corruption knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated than I'm afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home.,0.031,0.891,0.077,0.4749
first,WILLIAMSON,I want a politics that goes much deeper. I want a politics that speaks to the heart because the only way to fight  you keep talking about how we're going to fight Donald Trump. You can't fight dog whistles. You have to override them.,0.172,0.771,0.057,-0.7351
first,WILLIAMSON,And the only way you can override them is with new voices voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes atone for our mistakes make amends for our own mistakes love each other love our democracy love future generations something emotional and psychological that will not be  be emerging from anything on this stage. It will emerge from something I'm the one who's qualified to bring forth.,0.078,0.752,0.17,0.8689

first,DELANEY,Thank you Jake.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

first,DELANEY,Donald Trump is the symptom of a disease. And the disease is divisiveness. And I'm the only one on the stage talking about curing that disease which  with big ideas like national service by focusing on actually solving problems.,0.063,0.822,0.115,0.296
first,DELANEY,If we work together we can fix health care and build infrastructure. We can invest in not just technology but people and entrepreneurs whether they be in Storm Lake Iowa or Detroit Michigan or Baltimore Maryland. We can fight climate change and reimagine our education system. But we have to do it with real solutions not impossible promises.,0.096,0.839,0.065,-0.4635
first,DELANEY,Isn't it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government to lead us into the future? I promise as president I will restore vision unity and leadership and decency to this country. And that's why I'm running for president.,0,0.863,0.137,0.6705

first,RYAN,So in a few minutes all of the pundits are going to be looking at this debate and saying well who captured the left lane and who captured the center lane and who captured the moderate lane? ,0,0.943,0.057,0.2732
first,RYAN,I hope tonight at some level I captured your imagination your imagination about what this country could be like if we united if we put together real policy that weren't left or right but new and better. That's how we win the future. It's new and better.,0,0.678,0.322,0.9552
first,RYAN,A new and better economy a new and better education system a new and better health care system that focuses on prevention an education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids.,0.071,0.63,0.3,0.8442
first,RYAN,There's not going to be a savior. Not going to be a superstar that's going to fix all this. It's going to be you and me. It's going to be us. That's how we fix this country you and I coming together to do big things to imagine the new country that we want by coming together not left or right. New and better.,0,0.934,0.066,0.4939

first,HICKENLOOPER,Thank you. And what a night. I've loved it. ,0,0.484,0.516,0.7506
first,HICKENLOOPER,I'd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life-threatening surgery tomorrow. Would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success who'd actually done the work or someone who had just talked about it? That's the question we're facing in this primary.,0,0.879,0.121,0.7351
first,HICKENLOOPER,I've actually got a track record as small-business owner as a mayor and as a governor. We expanded health care in Colorado. We got near universal coverage. We fought climate change directly. We beat the NRA. And for the last three years we've been the number-one economy in the country. We can wrap all that out.,0.041,0.903,0.057,0.2263
first,HICKENLOOPER,I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage but I'm also pragmatic. And I've done the things that most of these other people are just talking about. And I know I can get results. And I can lead the people of this country towards a stronger a healthier and a more secure future and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory.,0.057,0.778,0.165,0.8266

first,KLOBUCHAR,"Well thank you Detroit. To win we have to listen to people. And out there today is Casey Jo's mom. Casey Jo was a champion high school swimmer from a small town. She got sick went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was ""Mama it's not my fault."" And she died. ",0.125,0.712,0.162,0.4215
first,KLOBUCHAR,A lot of Americans say the same thing every day. And that is what I will stand up for and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen.,0,0.95,0.05,0.3612
first,KLOBUCHAR,We need someone that has people's back. We also need someone that can win. And I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa.,0,0.63,0.37,0.9559
first,KLOBUCHAR,I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like I've done as a senator where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead Democrat.,0.054,0.764,0.182,0.6564
first,KLOBUCHAR,And last yes I will govern with integrity. We have a president where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.,0,0.756,0.244,0.8126
first,TAPPER,Congressman O'Rourke?,0,1,0,0
first,O'ROURKE,We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been. And right now we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of the country that includes everyone. ,0.056,0.821,0.124,0.4357
first,O'ROURKE,My whole life I've been including people in the success of this country starting a small business with high-value high-wage high-skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America serving on City Council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day and in Congress being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country.,0.028,0.942,0.03,0.0258
first,O'ROURKE,And then in Texas this last year traveling to every county not writing anybody off not taking anyone for granted and at the end of the day winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state winning independents for the first time in decades and winning nearly half-a-million Republicans and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play and I can win them.,0,0.774,0.226,0.9545

first,BULLOCK,By 2030 we will have passed the point of no return on climate there are going to be 130 million more guns on our streets. I'll be in my forties then. If you have kids think about how old they will be then.,0.05,0.95,0,-0.296
first,BULLOCK,But here's the good news: It's not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time just before we ran out of time in 2020 we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats.,0.023,0.883,0.094,0.765
first,BULLOCK,We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win not only defeat this president but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office.,0.024,0.691,0.285,0.9427

My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. ,0,0.927,0.073,0.4588
first,WARREN,For me what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget every policy that we talk about is about who's going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires? Or is it going to go to our kids?,0,0.87,0.13,0.7149
first,WARREN,Right now for decades we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. And that means it has not been on the side of everyone else not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations people living in inner cities people living in small farms and small communities across this country.,0,0.883,0.117,0.836
first,WARREN,"How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote.

first,SANDERS,But it's not just the price-fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. It's what's going on in the fossil fuel industry. It's what's going on in Wall Street. It's what's going on with the prison industrial complex.,0.133,0.867,0,-0.7184

second,YANG,Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it.  Why do we need to do it?  We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job can be next.  If you don't believe me just ask an auto worker here in Detroit.,0.026,0.94,0.034,0.1027
second,YANG,How do we pay for it?  Raise your hand in the crowd if you've seen stores closing where you live.  It is not just you.  Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.  We need to do the opposite of much of what we're doing right now and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.,0.039,0.881,0.08,0.6227
second,YANG,So let me share the math.  A thousand dollars a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone.

You know we have a president as everybody has acknowledged here every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country but no one man has the capacity to rip that apart.  It's too strong.  We're too good.,0.049,0.78,0.172,0.7964

second,BIDEN,Mr. President this is America.  And we are stronger and great because of this diversity Mr. President not in spite of it Mr. President.,0,0.689,0.311,0.8582
second,BIDEN,So Mr. President let's get something straight:  We love it.  We are not leaving it.  We are here to stay.  And we're certainly not going to leave it to you.,0,0.729,0.271,0.8247
second,BASH, Thank you Vice President Biden.  I want to start the debate with one of the top priorities for Democratic voters and that is health care.  ,0,0.694,0.306,0.7783
second,BASH,"Senator Harris this week you released a new health care plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in.  Vice President Biden's campaign calls your plan quote ""a have-it-every-which-way approach"" and says it's just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your health care stance.  What do you say to that?",0.032,0.86,0.108,0.6705
second,HARRIS, Well they're probably confused because they've not read it.  But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families listening to experts listening to health care providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long that American families have to be held down by deductibles and co-pays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.  ,0.022,0.832,0.146,0.8999
second,HARRIS,I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan so I devised a plan where it's going to be 10 years of a transition.,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS,I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan.  So I designed a plan where yes responsive to the needs of American families there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare.,0,0.879,0.121,0.6705
second,HARRIS,Because the bottom line is this:  We must agree that access to health care must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.  And in America today far too many people  in fact 30 million people  are going without access to health care.,0.039,0.796,0.165,0.7776
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.  Thank you Senator Harris.  Vice President Biden your response.  ,0,0.667,0.333,0.6124
second,BIDEN, Well my response is that the senator has had several plans so far.  And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years you should wonder why it takes 10 years.  ,0,0.872,0.128,0.6124
second,BIDEN,If you noticed there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion.  You will lose your employer-based insurance.  And in fact you know this is the single most important issue facing the public.  And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward you can't beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.,0.075,0.892,0.032,-0.4228
second,BASH, Your response Senator Harris?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, Absolutely.  Unfortunately Vice President Biden you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing.  The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system.  ,0.077,0.831,0.092,0.1298
second,HARRIS,Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day.  Babies will be born into our plan and right now 4 million babies almost are born every day in America  or every year in America.  Under our plan we will ensure that everyone has access to health care.,0,0.859,0.141,0.7717
second,HARRIS,Your plan by contrast leaves out almost 10 million Americans.  So I think that you should really think about what you're saying but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.,0.033,0.831,0.136,0.6652
second,BASH, Senator Harris thank you.  Vice President Biden your response?  ,0,0.762,0.238,0.3612
second,BIDEN, The plan no matter how you cut it costs $3 trillion when it is in fact employed number one.  Ten years from now after two terms of the senator being president after her time.  ,0.117,0.817,0.065,-0.4404
second,BIDEN,Secondly it will require middle-class taxes to go up not down.  Thirdly it will eliminate employer-based insurance.  And fourthly what happens in the meantime?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, I'd like to respond.  First of all the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive.  Second we are now paying $3 trillion a year for health care in America.  Over the next 10 years it's probably going to be $6 trillion.  We must act.  ,0,0.881,0.119,0.6908
second,HARRIS,My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage.  Right now in America we have seniors who every day  millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need.  All people should have access to health care.  And costs should not be their barrier.,0,0.928,0.072,0.5529
second,BASH, Thank you Senator Harris.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,BASH,Mayor de Blasio let's bring you in here.  What's your response?,0,1,0,0
second,DE BLASIO, Thank you.  I don't know what the vice president and the senator are talking about.  The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them.  ,0,0.921,0.079,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO,There's tens of millions of Americans who don't even have health insurance tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the co-pays the deductibles the premiums the out-of-pocket expenses.,0,1,0,0
second,DE BLASIO,There's this mythology that somehow all of these folks are in love with their insurance in America.  What I hear from union members and from hard-working middle-class people is they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental care,0.043,0.697,0.261,0.9423

second,BASH, Thank you Mr. Mayor.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,BASH,Vice President Biden you just heard Mayor de Blasio.  He said in the past that Democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a health care system that is not working.  What's your response?,0,0.916,0.084,0.4939
second,BIDEN, My response is Obamacare is working.  The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare.  Go back and do  take back all the things that Trump took away provide a public option meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan or if they're on Medicaid they'd automatically be in the plan.  ,0.03,0.97,0,-0.2755
second,BIDEN,It would take place immediately.  It would move quickly.  And it would insure the vast vast vast majority of Americans.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,In the meantime what happens?  Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost?  My plan costs $750 billion.  That's what it costs.  Not $30 trillion.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Senator Gillibrand you support Medicare for All.  How do you feel about Senator Harris continuing to call her health proposal Medicare for All when it includes a far more significant role for private insurance than the bill you co-sponsored?  ,0,0.846,0.154,0.7425
second,GILLIBRAND, I think for the viewers in the audience right now they're at risk of losing the forest through the trees because the truth is health care in America should be a right.  ,0.13,0.718,0.152,0.2023
second,GILLIBRAND,When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy.  I had to rush him to the emergency room.  My heart is palpitating because I'm worried that his throat will close.  I am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet.  I know whatever they're going to prescribe whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler I can afford it.,0.111,0.857,0.031,-0.6808
second,GILLIBRAND,The truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it.  They cannot afford  and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies I'm sorry they're for-profit companies.  They have an obligation to their shareholders.  They pay their CEO millions of dollars.  They have to have quarterly profits.,0.046,0.812,0.142,0.7717
second,GILLIBRAND,They have fat in the system that's real and it should be going to health care.  So let's not lose the forest for the trees.,0,0.801,0.199,0.6929
second,GILLIBRAND,And last let's not forget what the Republicans are doing because the truth is the Republicans and Trump their whole goal is to take away your health care.,0,0.777,0.223,0.7324
second,BASH, Thank you.  ,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612

second,BASH, Thank you Senator Gillibrand.  Senator Harris your response?  ,0,0.737,0.263,0.3612
second,HARRIS, In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all.  Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.  ,0,0.784,0.216,0.9412
second,HARRIS,In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising I couldn't agree more.  Senator Biden your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo doing business as usual and that's going to be about jacking up co-pays jacking up deductibles,0.046,0.913,0.041,-0.0541
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612

second,HARRIS,  have to come out $5000.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be $1000 because we further support the  the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.  ,0,0.8,0.2,0.6124
second,BIDEN,Secondly the idea that this is somehow a bad idea no one has to keep their private insurance but they - if they like their insurance they should be able to keep it.  Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.,0.082,0.807,0.111,0.3397
second,BIDEN,It says if the 160 million who have it say they like their employer insurance they should have a right to have it.  If they don't they can buy into the Biden plan which is Obamacare with -,0,0.933,0.067,0.3612
second,BASH, Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Thank you.  Senator Booker let me bring you in here.  You say you support Medicare for All.  You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for a government plan but that's what Medicare for All would do.,0,0.903,0.097,0.5187
second,BASH,So how do you square that?,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER, Well first of all let me just say that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare.  There is a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions.,0,0.871,0.129,0.8271
second,BOOKER,And so I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me always keep your eyes on the prize.  And that is that in the United States of America every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare that it's a human right.  And how we get there it has to be to end this broken system because we are on our way just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.,0.039,0.896,0.065,0.3559
second,BOOKER,And we spend more than every other nation on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs multiple mores than other countries - multiple more than other countries.  And so do you want to know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for All - where everyone is covered.,0,0.971,0.029,0.144
second,BOOKER,But this pitting against progressives against moderates saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here.  And I'm -,0.147,0.789,0.065,-0.5312
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,BOOKER, - going to keep fighting for that.,0.333,0.667,0,-0.3612
second,BASH, Congressman Gabbard what's your response?,0,1,0,0
second,GABBARD, The reality is right now we don't have a healthcare system.  We have a sick care system and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it.  So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table writing this legislation.,0.154,0.748,0.098,-0.6399
second,GABBARD,Now Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill.  This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal.  Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage a private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan.  If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.,0.102,0.79,0.109,0.1779
second,BASH, Senior Harris your response?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, Well unfortunately Representative Gabbard got it wrong.  Kathleen Sebelius did not write my plan; she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to healthcare in America.  And when we talk about this again I'm going to back to Vice President Biden because your plan does not cover everyone in America.,0.073,0.818,0.109,0.4215
second,HARRIS,By your staffs and your own definition 10 million people - as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare.  And in 2019 in America for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone I think is without excuse.  Our plan covers everyone -,0.025,0.975,0,-0.0572

second,BASH, Thank you Senator.  Vice President Biden your response?,0,0.737,0.263,0.3612
second,BIDEN, My plan does - will cover everyone number one.  Number two the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices.  The biopharma is now where things are going to go.  It's no longer chemicals.  It's about all these breakthroughs that we have with the whole (ph),0.044,0.904,0.052,-0.1531
second,BIDEN,#NAME?,0,0.364,0.636,0.3612
second,BIDEN,And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says as you develop a drug you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for.  We will set the price.  And secondly it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Vice President.  I want to bring in Senator Bennet.  Last night on this stage one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on Medicare for All would get Donald Trump reelected.,0,0.891,0.109,0.4215
second,BENNET, I agree that it makes it much more likely.  Unlike others on this stage I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade through two tough races in Colorado.  I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance.,0.021,0.821,0.159,0.8442
second,BENNET,It requires the drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition.  That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.,0.059,0.941,0,-0.5574
second,BENNET,As Joe Biden said we don't need to do that.  It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and  and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we pass a public option trust the American people to make the right decision and have universal healthcare in this country in two years not 10 years.,0,0.918,0.082,0.6808
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.  Secretary Castro I want to bring you in ,0,0.678,0.322,0.4215
second,HARRIS, I  I need to respond.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER,Your response.  I'll come to you right after Secretary Castro.  Secretary Castro.,0,1,0,0
second,CASTRO, Well I know that this is something very personal for all Americans.  You know I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse.  That whole time she had Medicare.  ,0.154,0.794,0.052,-0.6249
second,CASTRO,I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it.  I also believe thought that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that.,0,0.807,0.193,0.8176
second,CASTRO,What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation whether somebody gets healthcare or not.,0,0.788,0.212,0.7906
second,TAPPER, Thank you Secretary Castro.  Senator Harris Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer based health insurance.  Is that true?,0,0.692,0.308,0.7906
second,HARRIS, Well first of all with all due respect to my friend Michael Bennet my plan does not offer anything that is illegal.  What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare meaning that where you work will not be a  where  the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work.,0.057,0.81,0.133,0.5859
second,HARRIS,I have me met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides.  It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan; we do that as it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies .,0.035,0.965,0,-0.2755
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan ,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, We will do that.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Senator Bennet I want to bring you back.,0,0.822,0.178,0.0772
second,BENNET, Senator Harris is my friend as well but I have to say if we can't admit  if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan which is banning employer based insurance we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well.  ,0.138,0.769,0.093,-0.3641
second,BENNET,We need to be honest about what's in this plan.  It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.  Do you know how much that is?  That is 70 percent of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years.,0,0.937,0.063,0.5106
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,BENNET, We don't need to do that.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET,We can have a public option to have universal healthcare in this country.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, I do want to bring in Senator Harris because he just suggested you were not being honest.,0.15,0.778,0.072,-0.3404
second,HARRIS, He  we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this.  You got to stop.  The reality is that - what  under my Medicare for All plan yes employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get.  They will be able to make that decision.  ,0.04,0.911,0.049,0.128
second,HARRIS,Private insurance companies and private carriers if they comply by our rules and play by our rules will be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan.  But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only.  They want choice and my plan gives that to them.,0.039,0.888,0.073,0.0772
second,TAPPER, Thank.  Thank you Senator.  Governor Inslee I want to bring you in.  You recently signed a public option into law which allows Washington State residents to purchase a state backed plan if they want to.,0,0.756,0.244,0.6908
second,TAPPER,But this may only save families in Washington State as little as 5 percent off premiums.  Is 5 percent really the kind of relief that the American people need?,0,0.806,0.194,0.719
second,INSLEE, No we need universal coverage.  And I'm proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done.  And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publically sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens.  ,0.048,0.815,0.137,0.6124
second,INSLEE,I'm also proud that we didn't stop there.  We're also the first state that has taken care of our elders our seniors.  We have a looming retirement wave coming up.  I'm proud that our state  our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.,0.028,0.71,0.262,0.9098
second,INSLEE,I'm also proud of this and I think we need to talk more about this as democrats it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country.  And we are  we are,0,0.861,0.139,0.6124
second,INSLEE,We are having  we've had some success in integrating mental health with physical health.  There's no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health.,0.071,0.809,0.12,0.3612
second,INSLEE,And the last thing we're doing I think it's very instructive for the nation.  We know we're being eaten alive by pharmaceutical costs.,0,0.89,0.11,0.3818
second,INSLEE,We have had one of if not the most innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States.  That's a record of Washington state I'd like to take to Washington D.C.,0.067,0.796,0.136,0.3974
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Thank you Governor Inslee. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.6124
second,TAPPER,Mr. Yang I want to bring you in.  You support a Medicare for All system.  How do you respond to Governor Inslee?,0,0.818,0.182,0.4588
second,YANG, Well I just want to share a story.  When I told my wife I was running for president you know the first question she asked me?  What are we going to do about our health care? ,0,0.753,0.247,0.7998
second,YANG,That's a true story and it's not just us.  Democrats are talking about health care in the wrong way.  As someone who's run a business I can tell you flat out our current health care system makes it harder to hire it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees it makes it harder to switch jobs as Senator Harris just said and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business.,0.034,0.73,0.236,0.9485
second,YANG,If we say look we're going to get health care off the backs of businesses and families then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom.  That's the argument we should be making to the American people.,0.095,0.823,0.082,0.128
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Yang.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,TAPPER,Mayor de Blasio?,0,1,0,0
second,DE BLASIO, Yeah I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal health care.  It makes no sense.  Ask the American people they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them.  Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies.  They feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need.  They get a lot of noes.  They don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies.,0.067,0.835,0.098,0.3818
second,DE BLASIO,Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold that says we don't need to be dependent on private insurance?  We can have a system that actually covers everyone.  You know what?  Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo.  How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people?,0,0.839,0.161,0.905
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Mr. Mayor just a 15-second point of clarification.  Who are you talking about?  Who's fearmongering?  ,0,0.84,0.16,0.4329
second,DE BLASIO, Certainly with all due respect to Senator Bennet what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes.  Americans right now are paying so much money for their health care ask people about the reality of premiums deductibles co'pays out-of-pocket expenses.  ,0,0.805,0.195,0.8271
second,TAPPER, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, That's worse than any tax and people are paying that right now.  ,0.22,0.78,0,-0.4767
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Mayor.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,TAPPER,Senator Bennet?,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET, This  this is  this has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry.  This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option.  ,0,0.938,0.062,0.4215
second,BENNET,Bernie Sanders who said last night he wrote the damn bill and he did just like I wrote the damn public option bill is the guy who says it will cost $32 trillion and that we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it.  He says that.  Republicans don't say it.  Don't try to district from the truth.,0.102,0.826,0.072,-0.25
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator Bennet.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,BENNET, You can't hide from the truth.  ,0,0.512,0.488,0.4249
second,TAPPER, I want to let Mayor de Blasio  and then I'm going to come to you Vice President Biden.,0,0.925,0.075,0.0772
second,BENNET, We need to be for universal health care.,0,0.686,0.314,0.4939
second,DE BLASIO, Senator if we as Democrats say we're done with private insurance has only hurt the American people in so many ways we're going to give them something that works for their family's full coverage that they can depend on.  If we say that then there's an election.  The American people get to decide.,0.061,0.939,0,-0.5267
second,DE BLASIO,The ultimate choice Senator is an election and this should be the party that stands for universal health care and says we're not going to accept anything less.  Right now in America so many people don't have the health care they need.  That is a fact.  Tens of millions of people including middle class people.,0.036,0.816,0.148,0.7855
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Mayor.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, Give them a chance to make that decision through an election.,0,0.818,0.182,0.25
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Mayor.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,TAPPER,Vice President Biden your response sir?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, This is not a Republican talking point.  The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare.  Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.  And in fact what we got is a public option that in fact would allow anybody to buy in.  ,0.086,0.821,0.093,-0.1531
second,BIDEN,No one has to keep their private insurance.  They can buy into this plan.  And they can buy into it with $1000 deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it.  And if they don't have any money they'll get in free.  So this idea is a bunch of malarkey what we're talking about here.,0.033,0.897,0.07,0.3391
second,BIDEN,The fact of the matter is  the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible.  It will be a deductible on their paycheck.  Bernie acknowledges it.  Bernie acknowledges it.  Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid.  And I don't know what math you do in New York I don't know what math you do in California but I tell ya that's a lot of money and there will be a deductible.  The deductible will be out of your paycheck because that's what will be required.,0,0.974,0.026,0.0258
second,TAPPER, Senator Harris I want to bring you in here.  Your response?  ,0,0.874,0.126,0.0772
second,HARRIS, Yeah let's talk about math.  Let's talk about math.  Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion and that is on the backs of American families.,0.079,0.811,0.111,0.3182
second,HARRIS,And under your plan status quo you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families.  In America today diabetes patients one in four cannot afford their insulin.  In America today,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS,  for those people who have overdosed from an opioid there is a syringe that costs $4000 that will save their life.  ,0,0.856,0.144,0.4939
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, It is immoral.  It is untenable.  ,0.375,0.625,0,-0.4588
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, And it must change with Medicare for All.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Your time is up Senator.  Vice President Biden your response?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, Real quick.  I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices flat out number one.  ,0,0.841,0.159,0.3818
second,BIDEN,Number two we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for of the $9 billion opioids they sell out there.,0,0.952,0.048,0.0772
second,BIDEN,They are misrepresenting to the American people what needs to be done.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,And lastly here's the deal.  The deal is let's figure out how this works.  We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like no matter what one it is and buy into a Medicare option.  And they can buy the gold plan and they're not going to have to pay  anyway,0.073,0.896,0.03,-0.1769
second,LEMON, Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Thank you. ,0,0.5,0.5,0.6124
second,LEMON,"Let's move now to immigration please.  Secretary Castro you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the U.S. border illegally.  President Obama's homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson whom you served with says that is a public declaration that the border is quote ""effectively open to all.""  How is he wrong?",0.143,0.733,0.124,-0.296
second,CASTRO, Thank you for that question.  You know if you elect me president you're not electing me to follow.  You're electing me to lead.  And open borders is a right-wing talking point and frankly I'm disappointed that some folks including some folks on this stage have taken the bait.  ,0.061,0.889,0.049,-0.1531
second,CASTRO,The only way that we're going to guarantee that we don't have family separations in this country again is to repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act.  That is the law that this president this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.,0,0.962,0.038,0.25
second,CASTRO,My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship that we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States.  That's how we can be smarter more effective and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.,0.019,0.742,0.239,0.9567
second,LEMON, Thank you Secretary Castro.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,LEMON,Senator Bennet what's your response?,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET, I disagree that we should decriminalize our border.  This is personal for me.  My mom is an immigrant and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland.  ,0.085,0.915,0,-0.3818
second,BENNET,And for those reasons I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote  I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the Senate with 68 votes that gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here that would pass the most progressive DREAM Act that had ever been conceived much less passed on the floor of the Senate and had $46 billion of border security.  Every single Democrat voted for that bill,0,0.934,0.066,0.661
second,LEMON, Senator,0,1,0,0

second,LEMON, Thank you.  Thank you Senator.  ,0,0.375,0.625,0.6124
second,BENNET, That is our position as Democrats.  ,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Senator Harris you have indicated that you don't think it should be a criminal offense punishable by jail to cross the U.S. border illegally.  How do you respond to Senator Bennet?  ,0.235,0.765,0,-0.8074
second,HARRIS, Well again with all due respect you know I  after the last debate for example I went to a place in Florida called Homestead and there is a private detention facility being paid for by your taxpayer dollars a private detention facility that currently houses 2700 children.  ,0.104,0.788,0.108,0.0516
second,HARRIS,And by the way there were members of us  Julian was there members of Congress they would not let us enter the place members of the United States Congress.  So I walked down the road I climbed a ladder and I looked over the fence.  And I'm going to tell you what I saw.  I saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks.  The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the books,0,0.964,0.036,0.4215
second,LEMON, Thank you Senator.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS,  that allow them to be incarcerated as though they've committed crimes.  ,0,0.692,0.308,0.4588

second,HARRIS,  and should be not treated like criminals.  ,0.209,0.495,0.297,0.2235
second,LEMON, Senator Bennet what's your response?  ,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET, I think this is one in the end that we agree with.  There's not a single person on this stage if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border.  And that is what this,0,0.935,0.065,0.3612
second,BENNET,That is what this administration has done in the American people's name.  They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility.  The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty.  That should be the symbol of the United States of America not Donald Trump's words.,0.06,0.835,0.106,0.4019
second,LEMON, Thank you Senator Bennet.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,LEMON,Senator Gillibrand I want to bring you in.  What's your response?,0,0.874,0.126,0.0772
second,GILLIBRAND, So I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime you have to remember who we're talking about.  When I was at the Texas border I visited with women who had fled violence.  A woman from El Salvador owned a small business gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money we're going to kill your family.  That's why she fled.,0.17,0.83,0,-0.9231
second,GILLIBRAND,Another woman was raped.,0.605,0.395,0,-0.6808
second,GILLIBRAND,That's why she fled.,0,1,0,0
second,GILLIBRAND,So this is who we're talking about  and they're not criminals.  So I believe that we should have a civil violation.  No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it.  Because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children to separate mothers and babies to put them behind bars.,0.087,0.865,0.048,-0.3404
second,GILLIBRAND,So I don't think we should have a law on the books that can be so misused.  It should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.,0.091,0.767,0.142,0.2023
second,LEMON, Thank you Senator. ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,LEMON,Vice President Biden in the first two years of the Obama administration nearly 800000 immigrants were deported far more than during President Trump's first two years.  Would the higher deportation rates resume if you were president?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, Absolutely not number one.  Number two everything landed on the president's desk but locusts.  I found that Julian  excuse me  the secretary we sat together in many meetings.  I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. ,0.058,0.907,0.036,0.0229

second,LEMON, We can hear fine Mr. Vice President. ,0,0.769,0.231,0.2023
second,BIDEN, OK.,0,0,1,0.296
second,LEMON, Please continue if you will.,0,0.635,0.365,0.3182
second,BIDEN, The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum.  That woman the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum.  That is not crossing the border illegally.  What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.,0,0.918,0.082,0.5267
second,BIDEN,With regard to  with regard to the secretary's point I already proposed and passed,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,$750 million for Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,In addition to that we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case that they don't  that they have to wait in line.  The fact of the matter is you should be able to  if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back.  It's a crime.  It's a crime and it's not one that in fact,0.07,0.878,0.052,-0.5859

second,CASTRO,Let me begin by telling you  let me just start out by answering that question.  My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system because we do have a problem with that.,0.155,0.804,0.04,-0.6486
second,BIDEN, I agree. ,0,0,1,0.3612
second,CASTRO, Secondly the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law.  There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border.  It's a civil action.  Also we have 654 miles of fencing.  We have thousands of personnel at the border.  We have planes; we have boats; we have helicopters; we have security cameras,0,0.939,0.061,0.5267

second,LEMON,Mr. Vice President please your response?,0,0.685,0.315,0.3182
second,BIDEN, I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense.  Here's the deal.  The fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum.  People should have to get in line.  That's the problem.  And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump.  We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.,0.151,0.836,0.013,-0.91
second,LEMON, Thank you.  Congresswoman Gabbard what's your response? ,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
second,GABBARD, Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent inhumane conditions.  This is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies. ,0.114,0.809,0.077,-0.4767
second,GABBARD,We will have to stop separating children from their parents make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.,0.039,0.798,0.163,0.7152
second,LEMON, Mr. Yang your response?,0,1,0,0
second,YANG, I'm the son of immigrants myself.  My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for G.E. and IBM.  I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States.  That's the immigration story we need to be telling. ,0,0.81,0.19,0.836
second,YANG,We can't always be focusing on some of the  the  the distressed stories.  And if you go to a factory here in Michigan you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants; you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines.  Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.,0.054,0.946,0,-0.4215
second,YANG, Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON," Thank you Mr. Yang.  Senator Booker you have a plan that would quote ""virtually eliminate immigration detention.""  Does that mean that the roughly 55000 migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?",0.064,0.799,0.137,0.4215
second,BOOKER, Well first of all I just want to say again tonight we are playing into Republican hands who have a very different view and they're trying to divide us against each other.  I'm listening to the language of my colleagues.  No Mr. Vice President we are not going to just let people cross the border.  An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts or if you do in the criminal courts.,0.068,0.868,0.064,-0.34
second,BOOKER,But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country who no one surrenders their human rights.  And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to; seeing children sleeping on pavement people being put in cages nursing mothers small children.,0.142,0.731,0.127,-0.3004
second,BOOKER,This is not necessary.  We have seen using the civil system piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts where people are evaluated.  If they have no justifiable reason to be here they are returned.  If they are like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum.  We are butchering our values -,0.08,0.851,0.069,-0.2023

second,LEMON, Senator Booker thank you very much.  Mr. Vice President your response?,0,0.8,0.2,0.3612
second,BIDEN, I agree with the Senator.  The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it.  It has nothing to do with that section of law.  That's what he's doing number one.  Number two we should in fact - and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration I proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.,0.029,0.854,0.116,0.4404
second,BIDEN,This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people.  And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture.  Immigrants built this country.  That's why we're so special.  It took courage.  It took resilience.  It took absolutely confidence for them to come.  And we should be encouraging these people.,0,0.755,0.245,0.9577
second,LEMON, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,BIDEN, And by the way anybody that crosses the stage with a - with a - with a PhD you should get a green card for seven years.  We should keep them here.,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr. Vice President.  Governor Inslee what's your response?,0,0.706,0.294,0.6124
second,INSLEE, I think we're missing two central statements we need to make.  Number one we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House number one.,0.142,0.712,0.146,-0.2263
second,INSLEE,And number two - number two we have to make America what it's always been a place of refuge.  We got to boost the number of people we accept.  I'm proud of being the first governor saying send us your Syrian refugees.  I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's Muslim ban.  I'm proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row.  I'm ready for November 2020.,0.04,0.728,0.232,0.9246
second,LEMON, Go ahead.  Mayor de Blasio please your response?,0,0.753,0.247,0.3182
second,DE BLASIO, Two points.  One it's all kind of charade because there's 11 million people here and everyone in theory has broken the law but they're part of our communities now.  They're part of our economy.  They're our neighbors.  Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty when it's an American reality?  ,0.217,0.783,0,-0.9398
second,DE BLASIO,And what we need is comprehensive immigration once and for all to fix it.  Second Vice President Biden I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations.  You were vice president of the United States.  I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power your influence in the White House.  Do you think it was a good idea or do you think it was something that needed to be stopped?,0.049,0.859,0.092,0.5574
second,LEMON, Mr. Vice President -,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, The president came along and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever dealing with the dreamers.  He put that in the law.  He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the - laid before the Congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people.  He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.,0,0.954,0.046,0.3182
second,BIDEN,Lastly he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place.  So he did - to compare him to Donald Trump I think is absolutely bizarre.,0.125,0.875,0,-0.6478
second,LEMON, Thank you very much Mr. Vice President.  Congresswoman Gabbard you are a co-sponsor of the College for All Act which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans.  One of the authors of that plan Senator Sanders believes college should be tuition-free for undocumented immigrants as well.  Do you?,0,0.856,0.144,0.7845
second,GABBARD, I don't.  I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they've been living in the shadows.  ,0.126,0.834,0.04,-0.4926
second,GABBARD,And instead of putting a band-aid on this problem fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenships that they are no longer treated as second-class citizens in this country.  We've got to look at the challenge that people all across the country are facing under crushing student debt.,0.165,0.766,0.069,-0.792
second,GABBARD,This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold creative solutions to be able to solve it.  This is about promise for our future and we've got to make those kinds of investments.,0,0.746,0.254,0.891
second,LEMON, Thank you Congresswoman.  Mayor de Blasio what's your response?,0,0.762,0.238,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, Yes I  I agree with the congress member but I don't hear an answer from the vice president.  I'm confused.  I asked the vice president point blank did he use his power to stop those deportations.  He went right around the question.  ,0.133,0.784,0.083,-0.4854
second,DE BLASIO,Mr. Vice President you want to be president of the United States you need to be able to answer the tough questions.  I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump he's not going to let you off the hook.  So did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake we shouldn't do it.  Which one?,0.054,0.821,0.125,0.6249
second,BIDEN, I was vice president.  I am not the president.  I keep my recommendation to him in private.  Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him.  That is not what I do.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system.  That's what he did.  That's who did.  But much more has to be done.  Much more has to be done.,0,1,0,0
second,DE BLASIO, I still don't hear an answer.,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Senator Booker please respond.,0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
second,BOOKER, Well a couple of things.  First of all Mr. Vice President you can't have it both ways.  You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign.  You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.  ,0,0.949,0.051,0.2732
second,BOOKER,And the second thing that this really urkes (ph),0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER,me because I heard the vice president say that if you got a PhD. you can come right into this country.  Well that's playing into what the republicans want to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.,0,0.856,0.144,0.4939
second,BOOKER,From are from shithole countries and some are from worthy countries.  We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone.,0,0.774,0.226,0.8689
second,BOOKER,Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.,0,0.719,0.281,0.481
second,LEMON, Senator thank you.  Mr. Vice President your response.,0,0.737,0.263,0.3612
second,BIDEN, The fact is that's what I said about this country.  We are a country of immigrants.  All of us.  All of us.  Some here came against their will; others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives.  And they did.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,that's what we're talking about.  That's what made us great.  And the fact of the matter is I think the president of the United States Barack Obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.,0,0.833,0.167,0.7906
second,LEMON, Senator Gillibrand what's your response?,0,1,0,0
second,GILLIBRAND, Again President Trump under his administration seven children died in his custody.  In  under his administration families have been torn apart.  This party is talking about real ideas for the future.  We're talking about what we will do to change America.,0.121,0.821,0.058,-0.4404
second,GILLIBRAND,But we must not forget about our values.  We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated.  We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us.  Let's remind the American people who we are why we are democrats and why we're running for president.,0,0.824,0.176,0.8613
second,LEMON, Senator Gillibrand thank you very much.  The debate will be right back right after this short break.,0,0.865,0.135,0.3612
second,TAPPER, Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.  We are live from Detroit.  ,0,0.8,0.2,0.4588
second,TAPPER,"I want to turn now to criminal justice.  Mr. Vice President Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan quote ""an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country"" unquote.  Why is Senator Booker wrong?",0.35,0.47,0.181,-0.8934
second,BIDEN, Well I don't  I think he is wrong.  I think we should work together.  He has a similar plan.  I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.  ,0.106,0.822,0.072,-0.25
second,BIDEN,Right now we're in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime they end up going to jail and to prison.  They should be going to rehabilitation.  They shouldn't be going to prison.  When in prison they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.,0.237,0.722,0.04,-0.9349
second,BIDEN,And when they get out of prison they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before including Pell grants for education including making sure that they're able to have housing public housing including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.,0.05,0.784,0.166,0.6908
second,BIDEN,That's the essence of what my plan in detail lays out.  I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to.  And so I  you know I look  anyway that's what I think my plan  I know what my plan does and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.,0,0.921,0.079,0.6124
second,TAPPER, Senator Booker your response? ,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER, Well my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty mental health and addiction with locking people up and not lifting them up. ,0.187,0.759,0.053,-0.743
second,BOOKER,And,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER,Mr. Vice President has said that since the 1970s every major crime bill  every crime bill major and minor has had his name on it.  And Sir those are your words not  not mine.  And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws.  And you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.

second,BIDEN, The fact is that the bills that the president  that excuse me the future president here  that,0,0.925,0.075,0.0772
second,BIDEN,that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelming.  Since 2007 I for example tried to get the crack-powder-cocaine totally  disparity totally eliminated.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,In 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was  you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy; you  and engaged in stop-and-frisk.  You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal.  You found yourself in a situation where three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up.  The Justice Department came after you for saying you were  you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate and then in fact nothing happened the entire time you were mayor.,0.055,0.855,0.09,0.5106
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Senator Booker you want to respond? ,0,0.612,0.388,0.4215
second,BOOKER, Well first of all I'm grateful that he endorsed my presidency already.  But I'll tell you this it's no secret that I inherited a criminal  a police department with massive problems and decades-long challenges.  But the head of the ACLU has already said  the head of the New Jersey ACLU  that I put forth national standard-setting accountability.  ,0.132,0.734,0.134,-0.2263

second,BOOKER,I am happy to do that.  Because all the problems that he is talking about that he created I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you were frankly  to correct you Mr. Vice President  you were bragging calling it the Biden crime bill up until 2015.,0.144,0.768,0.088,-0.5719
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.  Vice President Biden?,0,0.667,0.333,0.3612
second,BIDEN, Number one the bill he talks about is a bill that in my  our administration we passed.  We passed that bill that you added onto.  That's the bill in fact you passed.  ,0,0.958,0.042,0.0772
second,BIDEN,And the fact of the matter is secondly there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt.  Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007 when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?,0.032,0.92,0.048,0.0258
second,BOOKER, Mr. Vice President there's a saying in my community you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor.  You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place.  The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms not just in action but in deeds.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER,"Sir you are trying to shift the view from what you created.  There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that ""tough on crime"" phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine.

second,BOOKER, But you've offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life.,0.314,0.686,0,-0.6705
second,TAPPER, I want to bring in Secretary Castro.  Your response sir?  ,0,0.86,0.14,0.0772
second,CASTRO, Yeah I agree with Senator Booker  I agree with Senator Booker that a lot of what Vice President helped author in '94 was a mistake.  And he has flip-flopped on these things.  And that's clear.,0.063,0.681,0.257,0.7506
second,CASTRO,But let me say when we talk about criminal justice reform there are a lot of things that we can talk about  sentencing reform cash bail reform investing in public defenders diversion programs.  I'm proud that I'm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it.,0.116,0.773,0.112,-0.0772
second,CASTRO,And whether it's the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue challenges,0.039,0.771,0.19,0.6886
second,CASTRO,we need to ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.,0,0.92,0.08,0.3818
second,TAPPER, Thank you Secretary Castro.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,TAPPER, I want to bring in  I want to bring in Governor Inslee.  Governor Inslee your response?  ,0,0.822,0.178,0.1531
second,INSLEE, Let me suggest that people come out to the state of Washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like our effort to reduce racial disparity.  ,0.105,0.712,0.183,0.3612
second,INSLEE,I'm proud that I was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes.  Now we're vacating more tens of thousands.  We've eliminated the death penalty.,0.185,0.672,0.142,-0.3818
second,INSLEE,And importantly we've done this:  When people come out of the legal system and they've done their responsibility to the citizens we need to make sure they can get a job.  We have banned the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out.,0.059,0.822,0.119,0.2732
second,INSLEE,And I've got to argue with my friend Secretary Castro.  We haven't just put forward a plan.  We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and trainer police officers and de-escalation techniques so we have less violence,0.128,0.72,0.152,0.2944
second,TAPPER, Secretary  Secretary Castro your response to Governor Inslee?,0,1,0,0
second,CASTRO, Well that it's much more than that because what we see  and this was a good example the other day of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that  Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD.  He did that for seven seconds.  Eleven different times Eric Garner said that he couldn't breathe.  He knew what he was doing that he was killing Eric Garner and yet he has not been brought to justice.  That police officer should be off the street.  ,0.046,0.83,0.124,0.7506
second,TAPPER, Mayor de Blasio?  Mayor de Blasio why is that police officer still on the force the one who killed Eric Garner?  Please respond.,0.173,0.746,0.082,-0.5514
second,DE BLASIO, Well let me tell you.  I know the Garner family.  They've gone through extraordinary pain.  They are waiting for justice and are going to get justice.  There's finally going to be justice.  I have confidence in that in the next 30 days in New York. ,0.059,0.662,0.279,0.9062
second,DE BLASIO,You know why?  Because for the first time we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution.  And years went by and a lot of the pain accrued.,0.115,0.764,0.121,0.0772
second,DE BLASIO,And in the meantime what I'm working on is making sure  and I have for five years  there will never be another tragedy there will never be another Eric Garner because we're changing fundamentally how we police.,0,0.854,0.146,0.7018
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mayor.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, But there's one last point I have to say about the Justice Department.  The vice president for two-and-a-half of those years Mr. Vice President tell us what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department to act in the Garner case?,0,0.858,0.142,0.7783
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Thank you Mayor.  Thank you Mayor de Blasio.  ,0,0.483,0.517,0.7579
second,TAPPER,Vice President Biden you can respond to that.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, We did a lot.  Number one we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38000 people number one.  ,0.142,0.647,0.211,-0.1027
second,BIDEN,Number two we in fact insisted that we change the rules that police engage in.  They had to have  we provided for body cameras.  We made sure  there were a lot of things that were changed in the process but 38000 people in the federal system were released under the system.,0,0.913,0.087,0.3612
second,BIDEN,And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done.  But here's the deal.  The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long long time ago.  And now all of a sudden you know  I find it fascinating.  Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues.  Barack Obama knew exactly who I was.  He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties and he chose me and he said it was the best decision he made.  I'll take his judgment.,0.031,0.858,0.111,0.836

second,YANG,We cannot tear each other down.  We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020.,0.167,0.833,0,-0.4588
second,YANG,I want to share a story that a prison guard a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me.  He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they're behind bars.  Right now we think we're saving money we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways.  We should put money directly into people's hands certainly when they come out of prison but before they go into prison.,0.143,0.805,0.052,-0.8308
second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Yang.,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,TAPPER,I want to bring in Senator Gillibrand.  You heard earlier Mayor de Blasio respond to Secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Garner is still on the NYPD.  Was that response adequate?  Please respond.,0.1,0.778,0.122,-0.25
second,GILLIBRAND, No.  He should be fired.  He should be fired now.  ,0.573,0.427,0,-0.8555
second,GILLIBRAND,"I sat  I sat down with Eric Garner's mother.  And I can tell you when you've lost your son when he begged for breath when you know because you have a video when you know he said ""I can't breathe"" so many times over and over again when you know he used an illegal chokehold that person should be fired.  And as  if I was  if I was the mayor I would fire him.",0.159,0.841,0,-0.8979
second,GILLIBRAND,But as president I would make sure that we had a full investigation that the report would be made public.  And if I wasn't satisfied we would have a consent decree.,0.076,0.786,0.138,0.2187
second,TAPPER, I want to bring in Senator Harris now.  ,0,0.822,0.178,0.0772
second,TAPPER,Senator Harris you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden's policies on race specifically on the issues of busing in the 1970s having benefitted from busing when you were a young child.  Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing you're opposed to federally mandated busing that that position is the same as his position.  Is he right?,0.04,0.918,0.042,0.0276
second,HARRIS, That is simply false.  And let's be very clear about this.  When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationists to oppose busing which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools had I been in the United States Senate at that time I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle.  ,0,0.87,0.13,0.8173
second,HARRIS,And let's be clear about this.  Had those segregationists their way I would not be a member of the United States Senate Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.,0,0.851,0.149,0.802
second,HARRIS,And so on that issue we could not be more apart which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time.,0.158,0.842,0,-0.7506
second,HARRIS,Now I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I too met with his mother.  And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States Donald Trump while he has been in office has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees to stop pattern and practice investigations.,0.028,0.767,0.205,0.9153
second,HARRIS,On that case we also know that the,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS,  Civil Rights Division  this is important.  The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed but this United States Department of Justice usurped  and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward.  And they overrode a decision by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.,0.069,0.653,0.278,0.9556
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, Under my administration the Civil Rights Division,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS,  will rein and there will be independent investigations.  ,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Vice President Biden Vice President Biden I want to give you a chance to respond to what Senator Harris just said.,0,0.837,0.163,0.3182
second,BIDEN, When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,And she did not  I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them.  Secondly she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.,0.073,0.927,0,-0.4588
second,BIDEN,And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been  the police officer did something that did not give you information of what (inaudible),0,0.925,0.075,0.4588
second,BIDEN,your  your client.  She didn't do that.  She never did it.  And so what happened.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,Along came a federal judge and said enough enough.  And he freed 1000 of these people.  If you doubt me google 1000 prisoners freed Kamala Harris.,0.18,0.652,0.168,-0.1027
second,TAPPER, Thank you Vice President Biden.  Senator Harris your response.,0,0.762,0.238,0.3612
second,HARRIS, That is  is simply not true.  And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States second only to the United States Department of Justice I am proud of the work we did.  ,0.045,0.656,0.299,0.9212
second,HARRIS,Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.,0.073,0.754,0.172,0.5574
second,HARRIS,It was the work of creating the  one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.,0.09,0.83,0.079,-0.0772
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, I did the work as attorney general of putting body cameras on special agents in the state of California.,0,0.863,0.137,0.4019
second,TAPPER, I want to bring in Congresswoman .,0,0.755,0.245,0.0772
second,HARRIS, And I'm proud of that work.,0,0.617,0.383,0.4767
second,TAPPER, I want to bring in Congresswoman Gabbard.  Congresswoman Gabbard you took issue with Senator Harris confronting Vice President Biden at the last debate.  You called it a quote false accusation that Joe Biden is a racist.  What's your response?,0.186,0.782,0.032,-0.743
second,GABBARD, I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today.  Now Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president.,0.124,0.727,0.149,0.0772
second,GABBARD,But I'm deeply concerned about this record.  There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.,0.101,0.811,0.088,-0.1531
second,GABBARD,She blocked evidence  she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.,0.259,0.628,0.113,-0.8442
second,GABBARD,And she fought to keep,0.365,0.635,0,-0.3182
second,TAPPER,Thank you Congresswoman.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,GABBARD, Bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.,0.375,0.625,0,-0.802
second,TAPPER, Thank you Congresswoman.  Senator Harris your response?,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
second,HARRIS, As the elected attorney general of California I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.  ,0.085,0.829,0.085,0
second,HARRIS,And I am proud of that work.  And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.,0.069,0.863,0.068,-0.2617
second,HARRIS,That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.,0.135,0.757,0.108,-0.128
second,TAPPER, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,HARRIS,It is why (ph),0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS,and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken,0.415,0.393,0.191,-0.6113
second,TAPPER,Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, That I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize but legalize marijuana in the United States.,0,0.844,0.156,0.5719
second,TAPPER, Thank you Senator.  Your time is up.  I want to  I want to bring Congresswoman Gabbard back in.  Your response please (ph).,0,0.684,0.316,0.6597
second,GABBARD, The bottom line is Senator Harris when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives you did not.  And worse yet in the case of those who were on death row innocent people you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.,0.131,0.757,0.111,-0.3283
second,GABBARD,There is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe  you owe them an apology.,0.208,0.695,0.097,-0.5994
second,TAPPER, Senator Harris?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, My entire career I have been opposed  personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed.  And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty.  That is my background that is my work.  ,0.231,0.769,0,-0.93
second,HARRIS,I am proud of it.  I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage but when they're in the position to actually make a decision what do they do.,0.043,0.906,0.052,0.09
second,HARRIS,When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty.  History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.,0.24,0.595,0.164,-0.516
second,LEMON, Senator Harris thank you very much.  Senator Bennet a question for you.  Why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide that exists in this country today which has been stoked by the president's racist rhetoric?,0.089,0.761,0.15,0.4019
second,BENNET, Yes.  First of all the president's racist rhetoric should be enough grounds for everybody in this country to vote him out of office.  ,0.144,0.758,0.097,-0.3182
second,BENNET,Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama.  Thank you Barack Obama.  Thank you Barack Obama.,0,0.773,0.227,0.6124
second,BENNET,So you know I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they don't have to worry about going homeless because they can't afford a medical procedure.,0,0.835,0.165,0.8911
second,BASH, Thank you Secretary Castro.  ,0,0.545,0.455,0.3612
second,BASH,I want to turn now to a question about trade and for Congresswoman Gabbard.  Many saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of China.  You were against it.  How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage?,0.038,0.824,0.138,0.6249
second,GABBARD, By pushing for fair trade not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country that give away American jobs and that threaten our environment.  These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  ,0.055,0.896,0.049,-0.0772
second,GABBARD,I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass either a federal law or a state or a local law.  This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country.,0.06,0.887,0.053,-0.1027
second,GABBARD,What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment.  These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.,0.054,0.839,0.106,0.3612
second,BASH, So to be clear Congresswoman would you keep President Trump's tariffs on China in place?  ,0,0.83,0.17,0.4336
second,GABBARD, I would not because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers on our farmers who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.  ,0.201,0.799,0,-0.9115
second,BASH, Vice President Biden would you rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership which of course President Trump withdrew from?  Please respond.,0,0.881,0.119,0.3182
second,BIDEN, I'd renegotiate.  We make up 25 percent of the world's economy.  In order  either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are.  We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.,0.029,0.913,0.059,0.3182
second,BIDEN,And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now in the things that make them more competitive.  That's what we have to do.  Otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road.  We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.,0.047,0.85,0.102,0.3597
second,BASH, Thank you.  Thank you.  Vice President Biden just to be clear would you or would you not rejoin the TPP yes or no?,0.072,0.59,0.338,0.7964
second,BIDEN, I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward.  I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted.  Otherwise they're going to do exactly what they're doing fill the vacuum and run the  and run the table.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Thank you sir.  Mayor de Blasio you also oppose the deal.  Please respond.,0,0.696,0.304,0.5859
second,DE BLASIO, Yeah and I just want to ask this question of all the candidates but particularly of Vice President Biden.  President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0.  He's got a new name for it.  It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA.  It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA like it did to Michigan.  And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.  ,0.054,0.78,0.166,0.7684
second,DE BLASIO,So Vice President I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA.  Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA and that what you will believe in which is a lot of us hope for is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again not just multinational corporations.,0,0.894,0.106,0.7717
second,BASH, Mr. Vice President?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, Yes.  ,0,0,1,0.4019
second,BASH, Your response?  Your response sir?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, Yes.  ,0,0,1,0.4019
second,BASH, That's it?  ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, No he said would I insist that labor be engaged?  ,0.185,0.588,0.227,0.128
second,BIDEN,The answer is yes.,0,0.526,0.474,0.4019
second,DE BLASIO, I consider that a victory.  ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, Well I love your affection for me.  You spend a lot of time with me.  ,0,0.508,0.492,0.8658
second,DE BLASIO, You know what?  We believe in redemption Joe.  We believe in redemption in this party.  ,0,0.818,0.182,0.481
second,BIDEN, Well I tell you what I hope you're part of it.  ,0,0.583,0.417,0.6124
second,BASH," OK I'm going to ask a question of Senator Bennet now.  Senator CNN reached out to Michigan Democratic primary voters for their most pressing question.  Farris from Flint Michigan has this question:  ""Here in Detroit our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security.  How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?",0.059,0.773,0.168,0.7865
second,BENNET, Dana this goes to the last question you asked as well which is how are we going to remain competitive?  It's not just about trade which we were talking about earlier.  It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore.  ,0,0.913,0.087,0.4215
second,BENNET,Since 2001 we have cut $5 trillion worth of taxes.  Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America.  We have made the income inequality worse not better through the policies of the federal government.  We've spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East.  That's $12 trillion or $13 trillion that from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America we might as well just have lit that money on fire.  We've got to stop doing that.,0.125,0.801,0.074,-0.6131
second,BENNET,And we need to invest in America again.  For the money that we've spent that I just described we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country.  We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed.  We could have fixed not just Flint but every water system in this country.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,BENNET, We could have made Social Security solvent for my children.  ,0,0.789,0.211,0.34
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,BENNET, But we did none of it because of self-serving politicians in Washington D.C. who voted for deals that were good for them but not for Michigan or the American people.  ,0,0.937,0.063,0.2382
second,BASH, Senator Bennet thank you very much.  Your time is up sir.,0,0.8,0.2,0.3612
second,BENNET, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,BASH, Mr. Yang Mr. Yang women on average earn 80 cents about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men.  Senator Harris wants to fine companies that don't close their gender pay gaps.  As an entrepreneur do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees?  ,0.056,0.873,0.071,0.2023
second,YANG, I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned particularly in start-ups and entrepreneurship.  We have to do more at every step.  And if you're a woman entrepreneur the obstacles start not just at home but then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one.  ,0.067,0.933,0,-0.5369
second,YANG,In order to give women a leg up what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation including the ones who are in exploitive and abusive jobs and relationships around the country.  I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea but right now is stuck where she is.,0.108,0.892,0,-0.7469
second,YANG,What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses and the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1000 a month into their hands.,0,0.775,0.225,0.9062
second,YANG,It would be a game-changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.  It will not change unless we change it.  And I say that's just what we do.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Senator Harris your response?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, I think that's support of my proposal which is this.  Since 1963 when we passed the Equal Pay Act we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work.  Fast forward to the year of our lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar black women 61 cents Native American woman 58 cents Latinas 53 cents.,0.022,0.937,0.041,0.3182
second,HARRIS,I'm done with the conversation.  So yes I am proposing in order to deal with this one I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work.  Two they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they're paying men and women they will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profit.  That will get everybody's attention.,0,0.916,0.084,0.7089
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,HARRIS, Time for action.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Senator Gillibrand what's your response?  Will fining companies help solve the problem?  ,0.163,0.543,0.293,0.2869
second,GILLIBRAND, I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace.  ,0,0.714,0.286,0.7783
second,GILLIBRAND,"And I want to address Vice President Biden directly.  When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for childcare he wrote an op-ed.  He voted against it the only vote but what he wrote in an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would quote ""create the deterioration of family.""  He also said that women who were working outside the home were quote ""avoiding responsibility.""",0.044,0.903,0.054,-0.0772
second,GILLIBRAND,And I just need to understand as a woman who's worked my entire career as the primary wage earner as the primary caregiver in fact the second  my second son Henry is here and I had him when I was a member of Congress.,0,1,0,0
second,GILLIBRAND,So under Vice President Biden's analysis am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family because I had access to quality affordable day care?  I just want to know what he meant when he said that.,0,0.883,0.117,0.5423
second,BIDEN, That was a long time ago and here's what it was about.  It would have given people making today $100000 a year a tax break for childcare.  I did not want that.  I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100000.  And that's what it was about.  ,0.027,0.973,0,-0.0572
second,BIDEN,As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself I have some idea what it cost.,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $8000 tax credit now.  That would put 700000 women back to work increase the GDP by almost 8/10 of 1 percent.  It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things why can't we do it this way?,0,0.84,0.16,0.836
second,GILLIBRAND, But Mr. Vice President you didn't answer my question.  What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home it's resulting in quote the deterioration of family ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, No what I ,0.688,0.312,0,-0.296
second,GILLIBRAND, And that we are voiding  these are quotes.  It was the title of the op-ed and that just causes concern for me because we know America's women are working.  4 out of 10 moms have to work.  They're the primary or sole wagers.  They actually have to put food on the table.  ,0,1,0,0
second,GILLIBRAND,8 out of 10 moms are working today.  Most women have to work to provide for their kids.  Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.,0,0.882,0.118,0.4588
second,BASH, Thank you Senator.  Let the vice president respond now thank you.,0,0.643,0.357,0.6124
second,GILLIBRAND, So either you don't believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN, The very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children.  My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children.  The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened.  ,0,0.971,0.029,0.0258
second,BIDEN,I wrote the Violence against Women Act.  Lilly Ledbetter.  I was deeply involved in making sure the equal pay amendments.  I was deeply involved on all these things.  I came up with the it's on us proposal to see to it that women were treated more decently on college campuses.,0.108,0.846,0.045,-0.4939
second,BIDEN,You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful.  I'm passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally.  I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president.,0,0.767,0.233,0.8555
second,GILLIBRAND, So I understand  Mr. Vice President  Mr. Vice President I respect you deeply.  I respect you deeply but those words are very specific.  You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family.  ,0,0.886,0.114,0.4767

second,BIDEN, I never believed it.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, Thank you.  Senator Harris please respond.,0,0.455,0.545,0.5859
second,HARRIS, Well I just  listen I mean talk about now running for president you change your position on the Hyde Amendment Vice President where you mad a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest.  ,0.224,0.741,0.035,-0.9042
second,HARRIS,Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that?  Because you have only since you've been running for president this time said that you had  you in some way would take that back or you didn't agree with the decision that you made over many many years.,0.093,0.907,0,-0.6007

second,BIDEN, The fact is that the senator knows that that's not position.  Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point. ,0,1,0,0
second,BIDEN,The Hyde Amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately.  But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact be (ph),0,0.938,0.062,0.3182
second,BIDEN,have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government everyone that  that could no longer stand.,0.1,0.773,0.127,0.1531
second,BIDEN,I support a woman's right to choose.  I support it's a constitutional right.  I've supported it and I will continue to support it and I will in fact move as president to see to it that the Congress legislates that that is the laws as well.,0,0.737,0.263,0.8885
second,BASH, Thank you  thank you Mr. Vice President.  Governor Inslee your response.,0,0.643,0.357,0.6124
second,HARRIS, Well why did it take you so long to change your position in the Hyde Amendment.  Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde?,0,0.942,0.058,0.2732
second,BIDEN, Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.,0,1,0,0
second,BASH, OK.  Thank you.  Governor Inslee your response?,0,0.479,0.521,0.6633
second,INSLEE, I  I would suggest we need to broaden our discussion.  I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority they have been almost always under paid. ,0.068,0.932,0,-0.4404
second,INSLEE,And that is why this year I'm proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States.  And I believe that that is long long overdue.  I think it is true for nursing staff as well.  And I'm glad that we've now passed in measures.  And I'm glad that we've increased our union membership 10 percent,0.018,0.664,0.318,0.9702
second,TAPPER, Thank you Governor.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,INSLEE, So unions can stand up for women as well.,0,0.792,0.208,0.2732
second,TAPPER, Thank you Governor Inslee.  I want to turn to foreign policy if we can.  Senator Booker there are about 14000 U.S. services members in Afghanistan right now.  If elected will they still be in Afghanistan by the end of your first year in office?,0,0.915,0.085,0.4215
second,BOOKER, Well first of all I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time.  A guy that literally tweets out that we're pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan.  ,0.049,0.775,0.176,0.7178
second,BOOKER,And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible but I will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline.  I will make sure we do it we do it expeditiously we do it safely to not create a vacuum that's ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.,0.177,0.733,0.09,-0.7901
second,TAPPER, Congresswoman Gabbard you're the only veteran on this stage.  Please respond.  ,0,0.813,0.187,0.3182
second,GABBARD, This is real in a way that's very difficult to convey in words.  I was deployed to Iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war.  Just this past week two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.  ,0.235,0.765,0,-0.9441
second,GABBARD,My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now.  Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan 14000 servicemembers are deployed there.  This is not about arbitrary deadlines.  This is about leadership the leadership I will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home within the first year in office because they shouldn't have been there this long.,0,1,0,0
second,GABBARD,For too long we've had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence the toll that it takes on our servicemembers on their families.  We have to do the right thing end these wasteful regime change wars and bring our troops home.,0.062,0.938,0,-0.5574
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Thank you Congresswoman. ,0,0.375,0.625,0.6124
second,TAPPER,"Mr. Yang Iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal and that puts Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon the ability to do so at the very least.  You've said if Iran violates the agreement the U.S. would need to respond quote ""very strongly.""  So how would a President Yang respond right now?",0.077,0.845,0.077,0
second,YANG, I would move to de-escalate tensions in Iran because they're responding to the fact that we pulled out of this agreement.  And it wasn't just us and Iran.  There were many other world powers that were part of that multinational agreement.  We'd have to try and reenter that agreement renegotiate the timelines because the timelines now don't make as much sense.  ,0.039,0.801,0.161,0.8608
second,YANG,But I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars.  Right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home.  What's happened really?  We've fallen apart at home so we elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies.,0.112,0.775,0.113,0.0056
second,YANG,What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home.  We've spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that have had unclear benefits.  We've been in a constant state of war for 18 years.  This is not what the American people want.  I would bring the troops home I would de-escalate tensions with Iran and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.,0.18,0.756,0.063,-0.8885
second,TAPPER, Governor Inslee your response?,0,1,0,0
second,INSLEE, Well I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment.  And there is no sort of primer for presidents to read.  We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions.  ,0.107,0.683,0.21,0.5423
second,INSLEE,I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war.  I was a relatively new member of Congress and I made the right judgment because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war.,0.151,0.849,0,-0.8316
second,INSLEE,Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president who would be willing to beat the drums of war.  We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions.  That was the right vote and I believe it.,0.154,0.846,0,-0.8316
second,TAPPER, Thank you.  Thank you Governor.  Vice President Biden he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in Iraq as a U.S. senator.  ,0.236,0.652,0.112,-0.7579
second,BIDEN," I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.  From the moment ""shock and awe"" started from that moment I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.  ",0.095,0.824,0.081,-0.2263
second,BIDEN,Secondly I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq he turned and said Joe get our combat troops out in front of the entire national security team.  One of the proudest moment of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming  all our combat troops are coming home.,0.072,0.838,0.09,0.296
second,TAPPER, Thank you.,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612

second,TAPPER, Thank you Mr. Vice President.  I want to bring in,0,0.648,0.352,0.4215
second,INSLEE, Mr. Vice President  I'd like to comment.  ,0,0.706,0.294,0.3612
second,TAPPER, I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq Governor  I'm sorry Congresswoman Gabbard.  Your response to what Vice President Biden just said.,0.044,0.872,0.084,0.296
second,GABBARD, We were all lied to.  This is the betrayal.  This is the betrayal to the American people to me to my fellow servicemembers.  We were all lied to told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was working with Al Qaida and that this posed a threat to the American people.  ,0.341,0.659,0,-0.9712
second,GABBARD,So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country to go after those who attacked us on that fateful day who took the lives of thousands of Americans.,0.098,0.817,0.085,-0.1027
second,GABBARD,The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us.  We were supposed to be going after Al Qaida.  But over years now not only have we not gone after Al Qaida who is stronger today than they were in 9/11 our president is supporting Al Qaida.,0.12,0.784,0.096,-0.34
second,LEMON, Thank you Congresswoman.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, We didn't talk about Iran.  ,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Let's talk about  thank you please.,0,0.455,0.545,0.5859
second,DE BLASIO, We didn't talk about Iran.,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Please.,0,0,1,0.3182
second,DE BLASIO, We're on the march to war in Iran right now and we blew by it.  ,0.218,0.782,0,-0.5994
second,LEMON, Please Mayor.  The rules  please follow the rules.  ,0,0.566,0.434,0.5574
second,DE BLASIO, I respect the rules but we have to stop this march to war in Iran.,0.384,0.519,0.097,-0.7964
second,LEMON, Mayor thank you very much.  We're going on,0,0.737,0.263,0.3612
second,DE BLASIO, And the Democratic Party has to stand up for it.,0,0.769,0.231,0.4019
second,LEMON,  and we're going to talk about another subject.  Mayor thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  ,0,0.704,0.296,0.6682
second,LEMON,Let's talk about now the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appearance in front of Congress last week.  When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office his answer was yes.,0.124,0.749,0.126,0.0258
second,LEMON,"Senator Harris you have criticized President Trump for interfering with the Justice Department and just last month you said if you were elected president your Justice Department would quote ""have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former President Trump.""  Why is it OK for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody but President Trump not him?",0.092,0.762,0.146,0.6145
second,HARRIS, Well I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do.  But listen look we all watched his testimony.  I've read the report.  There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable.  I have seen people go to prison for far less.  ,0.05,0.775,0.175,0.802
second,HARRIS,And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.  I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law including the president of the United States.,0.03,0.847,0.123,0.7783
second,LEMON, Senator Booker your response?,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER, My response is exactly that.  I've read the report.  I've read the redacted versions of the report.  We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of the America.  We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world.  He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.  ,0.062,0.849,0.089,0.4367
second,BOOKER,And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage.  I believe that we in the United States Congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately.  And I'll tell you this,0,0.915,0.085,0.4215
second,BOOKER,Debbie Stabenow now has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings because he is now stonewalling Congress not allowing  subjecting himself to the checks and balances.  We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution.  The politics of this be dammed.  When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world the question is is what will we have done?  And I believe the Congress should do its job.,0,0.903,0.097,0.8357
second,LEMON, Senator Booker thank you very much.  Secretary Castro what's your response?  ,0,0.8,0.2,0.3612
second,CASTRO, Well I agree.  I was the first of the candidates to call on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.  There are 10 different incidents that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice.  And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings.  ,0,0.794,0.206,0.886
second,CASTRO,As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute.  However I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you're likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.,0.128,0.745,0.127,-0.0258
second,LEMON, Thank you Secretary.,0,0.444,0.556,0.3612
second,LEMON,Mayor de Blasio I'm going to bring you in.  What's your response?,0,1,0,0
second,DE BLASIO, I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment.  But I want to caution my fellow Democrats.  While we move in every way we can for impeachment we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives.  And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.  ,0,0.923,0.077,0.6486
second,DE BLASIO,We need more talk about working people and their lives.  For example are we really ready  and I ask people on this stage this question  are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes?  That's something every American wants to know about.  That's something they want answers to right now.,0.022,0.728,0.251,0.915
second,DE BLASIO,So yeah move for impeachment but don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump.  The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.,0.079,0.732,0.189,0.6752
second,LEMON, Mayor thank you very much.  ,0,0.615,0.385,0.3612
second,LEMON,Senator Bennet how do you respond to this conversation?,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET, I think look as we go forward here we need to recognize a very practical reality which is that we are four months  we've got the August recess.  Then we are four months away from the Iowa Caucuses.  And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate which it surely would.  And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. ,0,0.868,0.132,0.8519
second,BENNET,I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump.,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET,He has to be a single-term president.  And we can't do anything that plays into our  his hands.  We were talking earlier about  about climate up here.  It's so important.  Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House.,0.053,0.853,0.093,0.2183
second,LEMON, Senator Bennet thank you very much.  Secretary Castro please respond. ,0,0.625,0.375,0.5859
second,BENNET, But we need to be smart about how we're running or we're going to give him a second term.  We can't do it.,0,0.886,0.114,0.4019
second,LEMON, Secretary please your turn.,0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
second,CASTRO, Well let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.  All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we're articulating to the American people.  We're going to continue to do that.  We have an election coming up. ,0,0.923,0.077,0.4767
second,CASTRO,At the same time Senator you know I think that too many folks in the Senate and in the Congress have been spooked by 1998.  I believe that the times are different.  And in fact I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment.  The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.,0.044,0.907,0.049,0.0772
second,CASTRO,"And what's going to happen in the fall of next year of 2020 if they don't impeach him is he's going to say ""You see?  You see?  The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment and you know why?  Because I didn't do anything wrong.""",0,1,0,0
second,CASTRO,"These folks that always investigate me they're always trying to go after me.  When it came down to it they didn't go after me there because I didn't do anything wrong.""",0,1,0,0
second,CASTRO,Conversely if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook we're going to be able to say,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Secretary,0,1,0,0
second,CASTRO," ""Well sure they impeached him in the House but his friend Mitch McConnell Moscow Mitch let him off the hook.""",0,0.694,0.306,0.7579
second,LEMON, Senator Bennet please respond. ,0,0.566,0.434,0.3182
second,BENNET, I  I don't disagree with that.  You just said it better than I did.  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.  It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that.  And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition,0,0.839,0.161,0.7955
second,CASTRO, Well my brother can.  He's here tonight.,0,0.741,0.259,0.2732
second,BENNET, Ah that's what I was going to say.  It's your brother that's given you that good feeling about the Congress.  ,0,0.794,0.206,0.5267
second,BENNET,That's what we should do.,0,1,0,0
second,LEMON, Thank you Senator.  Thank you gentlemen.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.6124
second,LEMON,The debate continues right after this.,0,1,0,0
second,TAPPER, Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.  It is time now for closing statements.  You will each receive one minute.  Mayor de Blasio let's begin with you.,0,0.9,0.1,0.4588
second,DE BLASIO, Thank you.  For the last three years we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other black versus white citizen versus immigrant.  And why?  So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else.  ,0,0.795,0.205,0.8428
second,DE BLASIO,We can't let them get away with it.  If we're going to beat Donald Trump this has to be a party that stands for something.  This has to be the party of labor unions.  This has to be the party of universal healthcare.  This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.,0.06,0.767,0.173,0.7717
second,DE BLASIO,And when we do that Donald Trump right on cue will call us socialists.  Well here's what I'll say to him.  Donald you're the real socialist.  The problem is it's socialism for the rich.  We here in this country we don't have to take that anymore.  We can fight back.,0.093,0.807,0.1,0.1027
second,DE BLASIO,If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy then go to taxthehell.com and join us so we can build a country that puts working people first.,0,0.821,0.179,0.7351
second,TAPPER, Senator Bennet?,0,1,0,0
second,BENNET, Thank you.  Thank you very much.  ,0,0.444,0.556,0.6124
second,BENNET,What I want to say to all of you tonight is we have been here before as a country.  We have faced challenges that we've  we actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought how hard they worked how hard they organized the votes they had to take the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic more fair and more free.,0.107,0.778,0.115,0.3919
second,BENNET,And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history who doesn't believe in the rule of law who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary who doesn't believe that climate change is real.,0.049,0.876,0.074,0.2732
second,BENNET,I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us all of us to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face but the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us.,0,0.958,0.042,0.2617
second,BENNET,We need to come together united against a broken Washington make Donald Trump a one-term president and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves.  We have to do it for them.,0.071,0.866,0.064,-0.0772
second,BENNET,Please join me at michaelbennet.com.  Thanks for being here tonight.,0,0.486,0.514,0.7506
second,TAPPER, Governor Inslee?,0,1,0,0
second,INSLEE, For decades we have kicked the can down the road on climate change.  And now under Donald Trump we face a looming catastrophe.  But it is not too late.  We have one last chance.  And when you have one chance in life you take it.  ,0.118,0.802,0.08,-0.4404
second,INSLEE,Think about this:  Literally the survival of humanity on this planet and civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president.  And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us.  And that includes making this the top priority of the next presidency.,0,0.909,0.091,0.6124
second,INSLEE,And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration not the first day but every day.  And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter I hope you'll join me because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests.  And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuel special interests.  Because that is our salvation what it depends upon.,0.037,0.672,0.292,0.9741
second,INSLEE,So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort.  And I will close with this:  I am confident and optimistic tonight even in the face of this difficulty because I know we can build a clean energy economy I know we can save our children and our grandchildren.  I know that we can defeat climate change and we will defeat Donald Trump.,0.116,0.663,0.221,0.7872
second,INSLEE,This is our moral responsibility.  And we will fulfill it.  Thank you very much.,0,0.69,0.31,0.6597
second,TAPPER, Senator Gillibrand?,0,1,0,0
second,GILLIBRAND, Donald trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country dividing us on every racial line every religious line every socioeconomic line he can find.  ,0.081,0.919,0,-0.3167
second,GILLIBRAND,I'm running for president because I want to help people and I actually have the experience and the ability to do that.  I've brought Congress together and actually made a difference in people's lives.,0,0.816,0.184,0.6486
second,GILLIBRAND,I also know how to beat Donald Trump.  He has broken his promises to the American people.  I've taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania and I'll go to all the places in this country.  I will fight for your family.  It doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter where you live it doesn't matter who you love.  Because that's my responsibility.,0.156,0.758,0.086,-0.3658
second,GILLIBRAND,And I've done this before.  I started out in a 2-to-1 Republican district.  I won it twice.  I've never lost an election since.  And I not only bring people together electorally but also legislatively.  I get things done.,0,0.89,0.11,0.4274
second,GILLIBRAND,So we need a president who's not afraid of the big challenges of the big fights.  There is no false choice.  We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters.  You need someone who can do both.  And that's who I am.,0.086,0.825,0.089,0.0516

second,TAPPER, Congresswoman Gabbard?,0,1,0,0
second,GABBARD, Thank you.  ,0,0.286,0.714,0.3612
second,GABBARD,Now Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us.  They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China and North Korea starting a new Cold War pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.,0.316,0.639,0.044,-0.946
second,GABBARD,"Now as we stand here tonight there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us.  And if we were to get an attack right here tonight we would have 30 minutes 30 minutes before we were hit.  And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say ""Incoming missile.  Seek immediate shelter.  This is not a drill.  Seek immediate shelter.  This is not a drill.""",0.041,0.897,0.062,0.1531
second,GABBARD,And you would see as we did as my loved ones in Hawaii did there is no shelter.  This is the warmonger's hoax.  There is no shelter.  It's all a lie.,0.179,0.714,0.107,-0.1531
second,GABBARD,As president I will end this insanity because it doesn't have to be this way.  I will end these wasteful regime change wars work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to de-escalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home things like health care for all making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe investing in education investing in our infrastructure.,0.193,0.698,0.109,-0.9076

second,CASTRO,You know this election is all about what kind of nation we're going to become.  You and I we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices people that fought in wars and fought discrimination folks that picked crops and stood in picket lines and they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today.,0.121,0.825,0.054,-0.5423
second,CASTRO,Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty.  And I'm not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion.  I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation with one destiny.,0.085,0.804,0.112,-0.1906

second,TAPPER, Mr. Yang?,0,1,0,0
second,YANG, You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate?  It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling.  It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie.  Instead of talking about automation and our future including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality TV show. ,0.036,0.906,0.058,-0.0289
second,YANG,It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.,0,1,0,0
second,YANG,We need to be laser-focused on solving the real challenges of today like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade or that most Americans cannot pay their bills.  My flagship proposal the freedom dividend would put $1000 a month into the hands of every American adult.  It would be a game-changer for millions of American families.,0,0.805,0.195,0.8849
second,YANG,If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1000 a month would mean to your community.  I have done the math.  It's not left; it's not right.  It's forward.  And that is how we're going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.,0,0.942,0.058,0.4939
second,TAPPER, Senator Booker?,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER, Thank you.  First I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit.  They're hosting us today and one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities including the city of Newark.  And Detroit is turning around and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us no one demean or degrade us or underestimate or worth.  We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause. ,0.136,0.709,0.155,0.4417
second,BOOKER,That's the history of this city.  My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit born to a guy,0,1,0,0
second,BOOKER,that was a UAW worker my grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression.  My grandmother joined him.  She was really entrepreneurial opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in this city.,0.179,0.821,0,-0.7906
second,BOOKER,That is the American dream.  And so many of us have stories like that.  But the dream of this country is under threat right now.  While my mom's generation 80  95% of baby boomers did better than their parents.  It's now just a coin toss for millennials.  We have a real crisis in our country and the crisis is Donald Trump but not only Donald Trump.,0.103,0.803,0.094,-0.3818
second,BOOKER,"I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump.  Well that is the floor and not the ceiling.  The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him.  He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room.  It's when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before.  It's what's going to save us now.  That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States not just uniting the Democratic Party but making sure that we put more ""indivisible"" back into this one nation under God.",0.032,0.855,0.113,0.775

second,TAPPER, Senator Harris?,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS, So in my background as attorney general of California I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another.  I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students put them out of business.  I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children. ,0.088,0.912,0,-0.6908
second,HARRIS,And I will tell you we have a predator living in the White House.,0,1,0,0
second,HARRIS,And I'm going to tell you something.  Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts.  And the thing about predators is this.  By their very nature they prey on people they perceive to be weak.  They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable.  They prey on people who are in need of help often desperate for help.  And predators are cowards.,0.102,0.82,0.078,-0.1779
second,HARRIS,What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years.  And let me tell you we've got a long rap sheet.  We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families.  We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents.  We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.,0.051,0.908,0.04,-0.296
second,HARRIS,So we must defeat him and then in turning the page write the next chapter for our country.  And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 3:00 in the morning.  And that is my agenda the 3:00 a.m. agenda that is focused on giving folks the jobs they need getting their children the education they need making sure they have the health care they need and the future they deserve.,0.038,0.84,0.122,0.738

second,BIDEN,Look I've said it many times and I think everyone agrees with this.  We're in a battle for the soul of America.  This is the most consequential election anyone of you no matter how old or young you are has ever ever participated in.  Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration  hard to overcome the damage he's done but we can overcome it.  Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way.  The America we know will no longer exist.,0.104,0.869,0.027,-0.7227
second,BIDEN,Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.  We have to let him know who we are.  We choose science over fiction.  We choose hope over fear.  We choose unity over division.  And we choose  we choose the idea that we can as Americans when we act together do anything.  This is the United States of America.  When we've acted together we have never never never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was.,0.074,0.854,0.072,-0.0516
